            "🔹 Summary: section 6417(h) authorizes the secretary to issue regulations or other guidance as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of section 6417, including guidance to ensure that the amount of the payment or deemed payment made under section 6417 is commensurate with the amount of the credit that would be otherwise allowable (determined without regard to section 38(c)). section 6417(d)(3)(d)(i)(iii)(aa), (ii), and (iii) provide special rules for a taxpayer making the election to be treated as an applicable entity for purposes of section 6417 with respect to the 45v credit (see part iii of this background). section 6417(d)(2) provides that, in the case of any applicable entity that makes the election described in section 6417(a), any applicable credit amount is determined (1) without regard to section 50(b)(3) and (4)(a)(i) of the code (that is, restrictions on property used by tax-exempt organizations and governmental units), and (2) by treating any property with respect to which such credit is determined as used in a trade or business of the applicable entity. section 6417(f) provides a special rule relating to any territory \\2\\ of the united states with a mirror code tax system (as defined in section 24(k) of the code). section 6417(d)(1)(a) defines the term ``applicable entity'' to mean: (1) any organization exempt from tax imposed by subtitle a; (2) any state or political subdivision thereof; (3) the tennessee valley authority; (4) an indian tribal government (as defined in section 30d(g)(9) of the code); (5) any alaska native corporation (as defined in section 3 of the alaska native claims settlement act (43 u.s.c.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: if a partnership or s corporation makes an elective payment election with respect to any applicable credit, (1) a payment is made to such partnership or s corporation equal to the applicable credit amount; (2) section 6417(e) is applied with respect to the applicable credit before determining any partner's distributive share, or s corporation shareholder's pro rata share, of such applicable credit; (3) any applicable credit amount with respect to which the election in section 6417(a) is made is treated as tax exempt income for purposes of sections 705 and 1366 of the code; and (4) a partner's distributive share of such tax exempt income is based on such partner's distributive share of the otherwise applicable credit for each taxable year (an s corporation shareholder's share of tax exempt income is based on the shareholder's pro rata share). c. electing taxpayers making an election with respect to section 45x credits section 6417(d)(1)(d) allows an electing taxpayer to make an elective payment election for any taxable year in which the electing taxpayer has, after december 31, 2022, produced eligible components (as defined in section 45x(c)(1)), but only with respect to a section 45x credit determined in such year with respect to such taxpayer. section 6417 rules for partnerships and s corporations section 6417(c) provides special rules for partnerships and s corporations that hold directly (as determined for federal tax purposes) a facility or property for which an applicable credit is determined. a. electing taxpayers making an election with respect to section 45v credits section 6417(d)(1)(b) allows an electing taxpayer to make an elective payment election for any taxable year in which such taxpayer has placed in service a qualified clean hydrogen production facility (as defined in section 45v(c)(3)), but only with respect to a section 45v credit determined in such year with respect to the electing taxpayer. b. electing taxpayers making an election with respect to section 45q credits section 6417(d)(1)(c) allows an electing taxpayer to make an elective payment election for any taxable year in which the electing taxpayer has, after december 31, 2022, placed in service carbon capture equipment at a qualified facility (as defined in section 45q(d)), but only with respect to a section 45q credit determined in such year with respect to such taxpayer.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: on june 21, 2023, the treasury department and the irs published proposed regulations under section 6417 (reg-101607-23) in the federal register (88 fr 40528) to provide guidance on elective payment elections (proposed regulations). those temporary regulations also were published on june 21, 2023, in the federal register (88 fr 40093) to provide guidance on the mandatory information and registration requirements for elective payment elections. after full consideration of the comments received, these final regulations adopt the proposed regulations with modifications in response to the comments described in this summary of comments and explanation of revisions. comments merely summarizing the proposed regulations, recommending statutory revisions to section 6417 or other statutes, or addressing issues that are outside the scope of this rulemaking, such as the calculation of applicable credits (including any bonus credit amounts) or recommended changes to irs forms, are beyond the scope of these regulations and are not adopted. the treasury department and the irs received 151 written comments in response to the proposed regulations.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: another commenter asked that the final regulations clarify that rural electric cooperatives that file either form 1120, u.s. corporation income tax return, or form 990, return of organization exempt from income tax, be eligible to make an elective payment election. however, several commenters recommended that the final regulations provide an exception to the general rule in section 50(b)(1) for territorial applicable entities making elections under section 6417 for investment tax credits, advocating that such a rule would provide better parity with domestic applicable entities making such elections and would advance the ira's purpose by improving access to clean energy investment tax credits in u.s. territories. two of these commenters noted that other sections within subchapter f of chapter 1 have similar statutory language, and one of these commenters thus requested that the final regulations be modified to include all organizations considered exempt from income taxes pursuant to subchapter f of chapter 1. in response, these final regulations adopt this comment and define ``any organization exempt from the tax imposed by subtitle a'' to include organizations exempt from the tax imposed by subtitle a by reason of subchapter f of chapter 1. thus, under these final regulations, any organization described in sections 501 through 530 of the code that meets the requirements to be recognized as exempt from tax under those sections is an applicable entity eligible to make an elective payment election. 5203), that is not recognized as an entity separate from the tribe for federal tax purposes, and therefore is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for purposes of section 6417. one commenter asked that the final regulations treat an applicable entity that is the sole shareholder of an s corporation as eligible to make an elective payment election for all applicable credits determined with respect to applicable property held by the s corporation, in the same manner as an applicable entity that is the owner of a disregarded entity would be eligible to make an elective payment election for all applicable credits determined with respect to applicable credit property held by the disregarded entity. one of these commenters stated that an electric cooperative may be described in section 45(e)(2)(a)(iii) as a not-for-profit electric utility that had or has received a loan or loan guarantee under the rural electrification act of 1936. another commenter asked that the final regulations also allow a ``pre-1962'' rural electric cooperative under section 1381(a)(2)(c) to be eligible to make an elective payment election.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: 1.6417-1(c)), such a partnership or s corporation would be an eligible taxpayer described in section 6418(f)(2) and may be eligible to transfer eligible credits.\\6\\ \\6\\ the treasury department and the irs acknowledge that section 6418 does not contain a provision parallel to section 6417(d)(2) providing that section 50(b)(3) and (4)(a)(i) do not apply to limit the determination of a credit in section 6417. thus, section 50(b)(3) and (4)(a)(i) may limit eligible investment tax credits determined with respect to a partnership or s corporation with applicable entity partners or shareholders for purposes of section 6418. a number of commenters requested that the final regulations allow applicable entities to make elective payment elections through an entity treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes, either if all the partners in the partnership are applicable entities described in section 6417(d)(1)(a) or if at least one partner in the partnership is an applicable entity described in section 6417(d)(1)(a). 6. pooled investment vehicles the proposed regulations did not provide a special rule for employee plans that are subject to the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (erisa) if they choose to invest through pooled investment vehicles, whether the vehicles are organized as partnerships or otherwise. however, as previously described, the treasury department and the irs are simultaneously issuing proposed regulations under section 761 in the proposed rules section of this edition of the federal register that provide additional guidance for certain renewable energy arrangements that can validly elect out of subchapter k. multiple commenters asked that the final regulations provide further clarity on tribal entities and allow co-ownership of projects. 1.6417-1(c) does not include an entity treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes (or as an s corporation), these final regulations do not adopt commenters' suggestions and do not allow entities treated as partnerships for federal tax purposes (or s corporations) to make elective payment elections, except with respect to a section 45v credit, section 45q credit, and section 45x credit. these final regulations do not attempt to establish any additional criteria by which a taxpayer can provide administrative or managerial services for an applicable entity without creating a partnership between the taxpayers for federal tax purposes.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: one commenter asked that the final regulations contain a safe harbor for determining the federal tax owner of the tax credit eligible project and recommended the safe harbor under section 142(b) of the code as a model. another commenter asked that the final regulations provide that income from applicable credit property does not give rise to unrelated business income tax (ubit). this should allow an applicable entity that is not required to file a federal income tax return pursuant to section 6011 or federal return pursuant to section 6033, but has placed in service an applicable credit property in 2023, to file form 990-t based on a calendar year and make an elective payment election with respect to the applicable credit property regardless of when the property was placed in service during 2023. these final regulations continue to provide, consistent with the proposed regulations, that, subject to issuance of guidance that specifies the manner in which an entity for which no federal income tax return is required under section 6011 or no federal return is required under section 6033(a) could request an extension of time to file and make the elective payment election, an automatic paperless six-month extension from the 15th day of the fifth month after the taxable year is deemed to be allowed. other commenters requested that the elective payment election could be made on the form 1120-w. as the form 1120-w is not an annual income tax return, these final regulations do not adopt that suggestion. however, these final regulations maintain the decision that, when a restricted tax exempt amount plus a general business credit exceeds the cost of the applicable credit property that was purchased with the restricted tax exempt amount, then the no excess benefit rule is reasonable and necessary, gives effect to section 6417(d)(2)(b), and is consistent with general tax principles.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the treasury department and the irs have determined that it is more consistent with the statute to allow only one election per specific applicable credit property; thus, these final regulations continue to unambiguously provide that it is not possible to make an elective payment election for the same applicable credit property for a second 5-year period and sec. 1.6417-5(c)(4) would have provided that, if a facility previously registered for an elective payment election undergoes a change of ownership (incident to a corporate reorganization or an asset sale) such that the new owner has a different employer identification number (ein) than the owner who obtained the original registration, the original owner would be required to amend the original registration to disassociate its ein from the credit property and the new owner would be required to submit an original registration (or if the new owner previously registered other credit properties, must amend its original registration) to associate the new owner's ein with the previously registered credit property. because the rules for short year returns are outside the scope of these final regulations, these final regulations do not adopt a special rule in response to the comment. 1.6417-1(e)(7) (in other words, a facility that produces eligible components, as described in guidance under sections 48c and 45x) during the taxable year (whether the facility existed on or before, or after, december 31, 2022) may make an elective payment election for such taxable year, but only with respect to the facility at which the eligible components are produced by the electing taxpayer in that year, only with respect to a section 45x credit, and only if the pre-filing registration process required by sec. 1.6417-2(b) with respect to any taxable year in which the electing taxpayer places in service a qualified clean hydrogen production facility for which a section 45v credit is determined, places in service a single process train at a qualified facility for which a section 45q credit is determined, or produces, after december 31, 2022, eligible components (as defined in section 45x(c)(1)) at a facility, respectively, the electing taxpayer will be treated as an applicable entity for purposes of making an elective payment election for such taxable year and during the election period described in proposed sec.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: 1.6417-4(c)(3) would have provided that such tax exempt income is treated as arising from an investment activity rather than the conduct of a trade or business and is therefore not treated as income from a passive activity under section 469. proposed sec. section 1.6664-4, for example, provides guidance related to reasonable cause in the context of accuracy-related penalties under section 6662. comments regarding reasonable cause standards as they relate to specific provisions concerning increased credit or deduction amounts available for taxpayers satisfying pwa requirements are outside the scope of these final regulations. thus, these final regulations continue to provide that existing standards and authorities for determining reasonable cause apply for purposes of the additional 20 percent tax amount, and do not adopt commenters' suggestions to create new, special rules for certain types of entities or for purposes of section 6417. as described in part ii.c.2 of this summary of comments and explanation of revisions, commenters requested that the final regulations clarify whether a taxpayer could amend its return to adjust the elective payment amount and avoid incurring the excessive payment addition to tax. additionally, because the only applicable credits with respect to which a partnership or s corporation may make an elective payment election are not investment credits under section 46, proposed sec. section 7803(e)(3) of the code provides that it is the function of appeals to resolve federal tax controversies without litigation.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: commenters requested that the reduction for restricted tax exempt amounts considered in the special rule for investment-related credit property acquired with tax exempt income in proposed sec. one commenter requested that the final regulations eliminate the tax return requirement for governmental entities that do not have a federal tax obligation, and another commenter requested a ``waiver process.'' while these final regulations do not adopt comments recommending a streamlined process for certain taxpayers, including comments suggesting the removal of a return-filing requirement, the treasury department and the irs will continue to monitor the elective payment process to determine whether there are areas in which more efficiencies can be created. one commenter requested confirmation that the cost determination necessary to calculate the extent of any section 45(b)(3) credit reduction with respect to a production tax credit facility should be based on criteria and guidance developed in the context of investment tax credits. it is not possible for the irs to estimate the elective payment amount at the time of pre-filing because the irs will not have adequate information, such as eligibility for bonus credit amounts to make such a calculation, but a taxpayer may be able to estimate the amount of credit by completing a draft form 3800 and any required completed source form(s).\n",
            "🔹 Summary: pursuant to the memorandum of agreement, review of treasury regulations under executive order 12866 (june 9, 2023), tax regulatory actions issued by the irs are not subject to the requirements of section 6(b) of executive order 12866, as amended. therefore, a regulatory impact assessment is not required.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: these final regulations mention a requirement to register with the irs to be able to elect payments as detailed in sec. the recordkeeping requirements mentioned within these final regulations are considered general tax records under section 1.6001-1(e). as described in the relevant portions of this preamble, the treasury department and the irs believe that the documentation requirements are necessary to administer the elective payment election under section 6417. these records are required for the irs to validate that taxpayers have met the regulatory requirements and are entitled to make an elective payment election. the collections of information in these final regulations contain reporting and recordkeeping requirements.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: in particular, section 6417 allows applicable entities to treat an applicable credit as a payment against federal income taxes and defines applicable entities to include many entities that may not have any tax liability. allowing entities without sufficient federal income tax liability to use a business tax credit to instead make an election to receive a refund of any overpayment of taxes created by the elective payment election will increase the incentive for taxpayers to invest in clean energy projects that give rise to applicable credits because it will increase the amount of cash available to those entities, thereby reducing the amount of financing needed for clean energy projects. 1. need for and objectives of the rule these final regulations provide greater clarity to taxpayers that intend to take advantage of the credit monetization mechanism in section 6417. it provides needed definitions, the time and manner to make the election, and information about the pre-filing registration process, among other items. the pre-filing registration process requires a taxpayer to register itself as intending to make the elective payment election, to list all applicable credits it intends to claim, and to list each applicable credit property that contributed to the determination of such credits. (rfa) imposes certain requirements with respect to federal rules that are subject to the notice and comment requirements of section 553(b) of the administrative procedure act (5 u.s.c.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: section 202 of the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 (umra) requires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits and take certain other actions before issuing a final rule that includes any federal mandate that may result in expenditures in any one year by a state, local, or indian tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million (updated annually for inflation). these final regulations do not include any federal mandate that may result in expenditures by state, local, or indian tribal governments, or by the private sector in excess of that threshold. nevertheless, on july 17, 2023, the treasury department and the irs held a consultation with tribal leaders requesting assistance in addressing questions related to the proposed rules published on june 21, 2023, which informed the development of these final regulations. v. executive order 13132: federalism executive order 13132 (federalism) prohibits an agency from publishing any rule that has federalism implications if the rule either imposes substantial, direct compliance costs on state and local governments, and is not required by statute, or preempts state law, unless the agency meets the consultation and funding requirements of section 6 of the executive order. executive order 13175: consultation and coordination with indian tribal governments executive order 13175 (consultation and coordination with indian tribal governments) prohibits an agency from publishing any rule that has tribal implications if the rule either imposes substantial, direct compliance costs on indian tribal governments, and is not required by statute, or preempts tribal law, unless the agency meets the consultation and funding requirements of section 5 of the executive order.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: an applicable entity or electing taxpayer (other than an electing taxpayer that is a partnership or s corporation) making an elective payment election applies section 6417(e) by taking the following steps: (i) compute the amount of the federal income tax liability (if any) for the taxable year, without regard to the general business credit allowed by section 38 of the code (gbc), that is payable on the due date of the return (without regard to extensions), and the amount of the federal income tax liability that may be offset by gbcs pursuant to the limitation based on amount of tax under section 38. the irs may adjust any election that results or could result in a payment to the partnership in lieu of a federal tax credit or deduction without regard to subchapter c of chapter 63. the irs may also make determinations, without regard to subchapter c of chapter 63, about the payment itself as well as any partnership-related item relevant to adjusting the election or the payment. the term guidance means guidance published in the federal register or internal revenue bulletin, as well as administrative guidance such as forms, instructions, publications, or other guidance on the irs.gov website. tax exempt income resulting from an elective payment election by an s corporation or a partnership is treated as arising from an investment activity and not from the conduct of a trade or business within the meaning of section 469(c)(1)(a) of the code. (3) special rule for investment-related credit property acquired with amounts, including income from certain grants and forgivable loans, that are exempt from taxation--(i) amounts included in basis.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the no surprises act added new provisions applicable to group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group or individual health insurance coverage in subchapter b of chapter 100 of the internal revenue code (code), part 7 of the employee retirement income security act (erisa), and part d of title xxvii of the public health service act (phs act). the departments issued interim final regulations to implement phs act section 2719, including the provisions related to external review, in 2010.\\7\\ an amendment to the interim final rules was issued in 2011.\\8\\ in 2015, the departments issued final rules to finalize the interim final regulations.\\9\\ among other things, the 2015 final rules address the scope of claims eligible for external review.\\10\\ state external review processes that meet the minimum standards must provide for the external review of adverse benefit determinations that are based on requirements for medical necessity, appropriateness, health care setting, level of care, or effectiveness of a covered benefit. section 103 of the no surprises act amended code section 9816, erisa section 716, and phs act section 2799a-1 to establish a federal idr process that allows plans and issuers and nonparticipating providers and facilities to resolve disputes regarding out-of-network rates. the july 2021 interim final rules also specify that consumer cost- sharing amounts for emergency services furnished by nonparticipating providers or facilities, and for nonemergency services furnished by nonparticipating providers at certain participating facilities, must be calculated based on one of the following amounts: (1) an amount determined by an applicable all-payer model agreement under social security act section 1115a; (2) if there is no such applicable all-payer model agreement, an amount determined by a specified state law; or (3) if there is no such applicable all-payer model agreement or specified state law, the lesser of the billed charge or the plan's or issuer's median contracted rate, the latter referred to as the qualifying payment amount (qpa). section 105 of the no surprises act created code section 9817, erisa section 717, and phs act section 2799a-2, which contain limitations on cost sharing and requirements for the timing of initial payments for nonparticipating providers of air ambulance services and allow plans and issuers and providers of air ambulance services to access the federal idr process described in code section 9816, erisa section 716, and phs act section 2799a-1.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: finally, these interim final rules require the collection of information related to the federal idr process from certified idr entities in order to allow the departments to quarterly publish information on idr payment determinations. as discussed in the july 2021 interim final rules, all out- of-network rate determinations regarding idr items or services eligible for determination through open negotiation or the federal idr process under the no surprises act with respect to fehb plans or carriers that are not resolved by open negotiation are subject to the federal idr process unless opm contracts with fehb carriers include terms that adopt state law as governing for this purpose. in resolving the disputes through the federal idr process, the no surprises act and these interim final rules provide that each party must submit to the certified idr entity an offer for a payment amount for the qualified idr item or service in dispute and other information related to the offer as requested by the certified idr entity within 10 business days of selection of the certified idr entity and may submit additional information for the certified idr entity to consider. the departments note that any rulemaking to fully implement code section 9816(f), erisa section 716(f), and phs act sections 2799a- 1(f) and 2799b-6(2)(a) will include a prospective applicability date that provides plans, issuers, providers, and facilities with a reasonable amount of time to comply with new requirements. these interim final rules do not include requirements regarding phs act section 2799b-6(2)(a), which require providers and facilities to furnish good faith estimates to plans or issuers.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: these interim final rules also amend the 2015 final regulations to add five new examples (examples number 3 through 7 in the regulation text) to clarify how the external review requirements apply to certain adverse benefit determinations involving items and services within the scope of the surprise billing and cost-sharing protections for out-of- network emergency services, nonemergency services performed by nonparticipating providers at participating facilities, and air ambulance services furnished by nonparticipating providers of air ambulance services under section code section 9816 or 9817, erisa section 716 or 717, or phs act section 2799a-1 or 2799a-2. first, these interim final rules amend the scope of claims eligible for external review set forth in the regulations implementing phs act section 2719 to include adverse benefit determinations related to compliance with the surprise billing and cost-sharing protections under the no surprises act. these interim final rules amend the regulations under phs act section 2719 to require grandfathered plans and coverage to provide for external review of claims covered by the protections of the no surprises act for plan years (or, in the individual market, policy years) beginning on or after january 1, 2022. this change is grounded in the text of section 110 of the no surprises act, in addition to the policy reasons stated earlier in this preamble regarding the departments' intent to implement this provision broadly. accordingly, these interim final rules amend the 2015 final rules to broaden the scope of external review requirements and explicitly require, to the extent not already covered, that any adverse determination that involves consideration of whether a plan or issuer is complying with phs act section 2799a-1 or 2799a-2, erisa section 716 or 717, or code section 9816 or 9817 is eligible for external review. additionally, these interim final rules clarify the scope of external review in light of new surprise billing and cost-sharing protections under the no surprises act and provide examples of which types of adverse benefit determinations will be eligible for external review.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: these advertising rule amendments affect all registered investment company and bdc advertisements that include fee and expense figures, and where the investment company presents total annual expense figures in their prospectuses. the primary commission rules addressing investment company advertising include rules 482 and 433 under the securities act, rule 34b-1 under the investment company act, and rule 156 under the securities act (the term ``investment company advertising rules'' in this release refers to this set of rules). we also are removing, as proposed, the provisions in item 27 of current form n-1a that relate to annual and semi-annual reports.\\88\\ \\88\\ the final rules generally require funds to reorganize the presentation of currently-required information. rule 482 establishes certain content, legend, and filing requirements for investment company advertisements.\\55\\ many of the rule's content requirements focus on advertisements that include performance data of certain types of funds, including mutual funds, etfs, insurance company separate accounts registered as unit investment trusts (``uits''), and money market funds.\\56\\ \\55\\ investment company advertisements typically are prospectuses for purposes of the securities act. separately, rules issued by finra regulating members' communications with the public provide an important source of advertising requirements and guidance for investment companies, as underwriters and/or distributors of investment company shares are commonly finra members.\\59\\ finra rule 2210, ``communications with the public,'' includes both general and specific standards for communications with the public.\\60\\ \\59\\ finra is a self-regulatory organization composed of brokers and dealers registered under the exchange act.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: we are not, however, defining a material change for this purpose as a change that would require a fund to file an amendment to the fund's registration statement under rule 485(a) under the securities act because we do not believe linking this new disclosure requirement to that rule is necessary. \\282\\ see use of derivatives by registered investment companies and business development companies investment company act release no. \\245\\ the commission recently adopted amendments to limit the requirement that etfs provide premium and discount information in their annual reports to only those etfs that do not provide premium and discount disclosure on their websites in accordance with 17 cfr 270.6c-11 [investment company act rule 6c-11]. \\120\\ see instruction 2 to item 27a of amended form n-1a (permitting a fund to include disclosure that is required under 17 cfr 270.8b-20 (rule 8b-20 under the investment company act)); rule 8b-20 under the investment company act (providing, ``[i]n addition to the information expressly required to be included in a registration statement or report, there shall be added such further information, if any, as may be necessary to make the required statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading''); see also proposing release, supra footnote 8, at paragraph accompanying n.117 (discussing, for example, that if a fund changed its investment policies or structure during or since the period shown, the expense, performance, or holdings information that a fund must include in its annual report may require additional disclosure to render those presentations not misleading). as proposed, the final rules do not amend this annual report requirement beyond a technical amendment to clarify that it only applies to etfs.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: additionally, this approach takes into account the differences in format and function between a reporting form that is required to support the commission's examination and regulatory programs, and disclosure--like funds' shareholder reports--whose primary audience is retail investors.\\346\\ \\346\\ see, e.g., money market funds reform, investment company act release no. therefore, the provision in the final rules specifies that the plain english requirements of rule 421 apply to shareholder reports, and disclosure in funds' shareholder reports must be provided in plain english under rule 421(d). one commenter suggested the commission consider requiring standardized language to help investors identify key information, and that the commission could improve readability by requiring funds to use standardized language for their benchmarking disclosures.\\343\\ a different commenter, however, supported the flexibility that the commission provided to modify information that otherwise would be required to appear in certain proposed headings and legends, if this information would not be applicable to a particular fund.\\344\\ another commenter recommended that the commission establish a ``uniform format'' for the annual report, ``as it has when displaying information on more-structured filings like form n-mfp, to enable investors to more easily compare funds.'' consistent with the proposal, the final rules also include requirements that funds use ``plain english'' principles for the organization, wording, and design of the annual report.\\339\\ in addition, as proposed, the instructions encourage funds to consider using, as appropriate, question-and-answer format, charts, graphs, tables, bullet lists, and other graphics or text features as a way to help provide context for the information presented. first, as proposed, the final rules include an instruction specifying that the information in annual reports must be appear in the same order as is required under the amendments to form n-1a.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: we are persuaded by the commenter and in order to facilitate the final rules' layered disclosure approach, the final rules require that the information on form n-csr should be made available on a website within 60 days--e.g., the same time period that funds are required to transmit their shareholder reports. providing this safe harbor by rule may obviate the need to provide exemptive relief from the rule's conditions under these very limited and extenuating circumstances, as we have done from time to time.\\450\\ \\450\\ see, e.g., exchange act release no. \\443\\ see rule 30e-3 adopting release, supra footnote 20, at n.168 and accompanying text (discussing similar requirements for the website link that rule 30e-3 notices must include, including commission guidance that the effect of this requirement is that an investor must be able to navigate to each of the documents that must appear on the linked website with a single click or tap). the new website posting requirement therefore mandates that funds post the information contained in items 7-11 of amended form n-csr within the suggested 60-day time period. some funds may submit combined form n-csr filings that include multiple series, as discussed above.\\447\\ the information contained in these combined form n-csr filings will also need to meet the presentation requirements of our rules.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the commission received one comment recommending that the commission replace the requirement that a fund deliver this information within three business days with an ``as soon as reasonably practicable but not later than fourteen business days'' requirement.\\454\\ we continue to believe that investors would be better served by requiring the requested materials to be sent within three business days of the request. a ``reasonably practicable'' requirement could extend the time frame in which certain investors receive requested materials, and conversely also could result in funds being required to send materials more quickly than within three business days, as funds and intermediaries may have the capability to send materials more quickly than this time frame. \\457\\ an instruction to this prospectus disclosure requirement specifies that the delivery requirement for the information that the statement references applies to ``other information such as financial statements that the fund files on form n-csr.'' \\455\\ see, e.g., rule 498(f)(1) (parallel delivery upon request requirements for funds and intermediaries relying on rule 498); see also instruction 3 to item 1 of amended form n-1a (requiring the sai and shareholder reports to be sent within three business days of receipt of a request). this commenter noted the disparity that the prospectus cover page statement appears to require the entirety of form n-csr to be provided to shareholders, while rule 30e-1 would require only items 7-11 to be provided.\\456\\ in response, we are adopting a change to the prospectus cover page statement that form n-1a requires.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: further, amended rule 482(i) would not apply to advertisements that provide the disclosure required by current rule 482(b)(3)(ii), but otherwise contain no other fee or expense figures. the current provisions of rule 34b-1, which largely relate to performance information, will continue to apply only to sales literature that is required to be filed with the commission by section 24(b) of the investment company act. finally, as proposed, the final amendments include a timeliness requirement for fee and expense information in investment company advertisements.\\550\\ the timeliness requirement applies to fee and expense figures as well as to relevant narrative information. a. inclusion of required fee and expense figures the final amendments to rule 482 will require that investment company advertisements providing fee and expense figures include: (1) the maximum amount of any sales load, or any other nonrecurring fee; and (2) the total annual expenses without any fee waiver or expense reimbursement arrangement (collectively, the ``required fee and expense figures'') based on the methods of computation for a prospectus that the fund's investment company act or securities act registration statement form prescribes for those figures.\\521\\ \\521\\ in an expense reimbursement arrangement, the adviser reimburses the fund for expenses incurred. we believe this requirement will help investors better understand how a fee waiver or expense reimbursement arrangement may affect their investment costs by providing information about how long the arrangement will likely be in place (including that it may be terminated at any time).\\549\\ \\548\\ see amended rule 482(i)(2); proposing release, supra footnote 8, at section ii.1.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: alternatively, the commenter suggested that if the commission were to adopt the proposed amendments, it should provide guidance that the amendments would not (1) preclude a fund from omitting non-material information relating to fees and expenses from sales literature; or (2) require that sales literature include disclosures that funds do not presently include their prospectus fee table presentations.\\558\\ \\556\\ consumer federation of america ii comment letter; cfa institute comment letter. as funds are increasingly marketed on the basis of costs, we remain concerned that investment companies and intermediaries may, in some cases, be incentivized to understate or obscure the costs associated with a fund investment.\\559\\ rule 156 addresses the types of information in investment company sales literature that could be misleading for purposes of the federal securities laws, including section 17(a) of the securities act and section 10(b) of the exchange act and rule 10b-5 thereunder. in addition, like current rule 156, the final amendments will apply to all investment company sales literature, regardless of whether the investment company's prospectus contains total annual expense figures.\\562\\ we are not limiting the scope of the amendments to rule 156 to a subset of investment companies because our concerns regarding materially misleading statements about fees and expenses are not limited to certain types of investment companies. the factors also could assist such intermediaries when they consider whether a presentation of fee and expense information in investment company sales literature is materially misleading under any other principles-based rule regarding investment company sales literature to which such intermediaries may be subject, such as finra rule 2210(d)(1)(a). the additional factors are designed to assist investment companies and their intermediaries, including finra members, when they consider whether a presentation of fee and expense information in investment company sales literature is materially misleading under commission rules.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: starting in 2021, certain investment companies have been permitted under rule 30e-3 to send a short notice that a semi-annual or annual report is available online to shareholders instead of transmitting the shareholder report, in order to satisfy semi-annual report transmission requirements under rules 30e-1 and 30e-2.\\621\\ for example, funds have been permitted to send a short paper notice instead of transmitting the shareholder report in paper. \\626\\ our estimate reflects the percent of open-end funds registered on form n-1a that included a statement notifying investors of their intent to rely on rule 30e-3 in annual or semi- annual reports filed on form n-csr in 2020. see also proposing release, supra footnote 8 at n.738 (stating that, in a june 2019 survey, the ici found that 97 percent of member funds responding to the survey planned to rely on rule 30e-3). transmission of the report is generally less costly for funds that choose to rely on rule 30e-3 than if they had not chosen to rely on rule 30e-3 because printing and mailing costs are lower for a short paper notice as opposed to a full-length report.\\624\\ however, to implement the requirements of rule 30e-3, funds incurred costs to make adjustments to their shareholder report transmission practices.\\625\\ we estimate that 89% percent of funds registered on form n-1a currently rely on rule 30e-3, and that the same percentage of uits currently rely on rule 30e-3 to satisfy shareholder report transmission obligations under rule 30e-2.\\626\\ \\621\\ for a discussion of uits that currently may rely on rule 30e-3 to satisfy their shareholder report transmission requirements under rule 30e-2, and how the final rules address these uits, see supra footnotes 495-499 and accompanying paragraphs. see rule 30e-3 adopting release, supra footnote 20, at section iii. see supra section i.a.1.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: the commission did not receive public comment regarding the specific estimates of benefits and costs in the proposing release, although it did receive comments suggesting that certain aspects of the shareholder report requirements would be more burdensome than the commission estimated at the proposal. \\633\\ see infra footnote 724; see also infra section v for details on the adjustments to the cost estimates that we have made though adjustments to the pra cost estimates, which are expressed as changes from the estimates in the proposing release in the estimated burden hours (and related costs) associated with relevant rule amendments. for example, because the rule amendments will provide fund investors with more tailored, concise disclosures than they currently receive, it is possible that readership of the fund disclosures will increase. we do not have reliable quantitative estimates of the extent to which the use of more concise disclosure will enhance readership compared to the baseline scenario in which funds continue to transmit the materials that investors now receive. as explained in more detail below, because we do not have, and in certain cases do not believe we can reasonably obtain, reliable quantitative evidence to use as a basis for our analysis, we are unable to quantify certain economic effects.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: regarding the presentation of fees and expenses, the amendments to rules 482, 433 and 34b-1 will require that investment company advertisements providing fee or expense figures for the investment company include certain standardized fee and expense figures, and that these figures must adhere to certain prominence and timeliness requirements.\\655\\ the amendments will apply to advertisements of any registered investment company or bdc. see, e.g., section 10(b) of the exchange act; rule 10b-5 under the exchange act; see also supra footnote 543 and accompanying text (discussing finra rules that require all member communications to be fair and balanced and not misleading). b. advertising the final advertising rule amendments will enhance the transparency of the fees and expenses that are associated with investing in a particular investment company.\\652\\ to obtain this improvement in transparency, the amendments will require that presentations of fund fees and expenses in registered investment company and bdc advertisements and sales literature be consistent with the relevant prospectus fee table presentations and be reasonably current.\\653\\ these rule amendments will require that funds use a consistent approach to the presentation of the fee and expense information that appears in fund advertisements and add to the pertinent factors that should be considered to determine whether or not a particular representation is materially misleading.\\654\\ \\652\\ as detailed in section i.a.4 supra, investment company advertisements typically are prospectuses for purposes of the securities act. \\634\\ as discussed in section ii.a, supra, the final rule amendments incorporate certain changes from the proposal to address commenters' feedback. under the rule amendments, funds also will provide investors with disclosures that better enable them to make performance comparisons among funds and between funds and other investments.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: ; see also, e.g., enhanced disclosures by certain investment advisers and investment companies about environmental, social, and governance investment practices, investment company act release no. amendments to the form n-csr requirements there also are benefits associated with the requirement of the rule amendments that funds continue to file on form n-csr certain information, such as financial statements and financial highlights, which will no longer appear in shareholder reports, relative to the alternative of not continuing to require such filings. this aspect of the final rules would affect those funds that change the index that they include in their performance disclosure in response to this new definition. funds also will incur costs of complying with the new form n-csr disclosure items. funds also will incur costs from the requirement of the rule amendment to transmit a separate shareholder report for each series and share class of each fund.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: for example, the amendments will require the fee and expense figures in advertisements to be calculated in the manner the registrant's investment company act or securities act registration form prescribes for a prospectus. for example, the advertising rule amendments requiring standardized fee and expense figures will affect only those fund advertisements that include fee and expense figures. it will be more costly to prepare these advertisements (if they include fee and expense information) because of the need to develop new procedures for annually calculating these registrants' fees and expenses in accordance with prospectus fee table requirements. this may require internal review and approval of advertisements beyond what occurs under the current rule, particularly where an advertisement is not already required to present certain fee and expense figures under existing finra rules (for example, advertisements by funds other than open-end funds, advertisements intended for non-retail audiences, or advertisements where a broker-dealer is not involved in disseminating the particular communication).\\743\\ for example, while many investment company advertisements are subject to timeliness requirements related to the presentation of performance information, they currently are not subject to similar timeliness requirements for fee and expense information. \\742\\ some comments on the proposing release stated that the proposed investment company advertising rule amendments would help investors make more informed investment decisions by more easily comparing costs among various funds.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: finally, we noted earlier in section iv.c.3.b that certain funds may respond to the final advertising rule amendments by limiting their advertising of certain fee and expense information. second, making it easier for investors to use the information that is disclosed under the rule amendments that require concise, tailored shareholder report disclosures and more consistent fee and expense presentations across investment company advertisements relative to the baseline could facilitate more efficient investor allocation of assets across funds. in addition, the rule amendments that affect the definition of a ``broad-based'' index will affect competition among providers of the index information that funds include in their performance disclosure. in addition, the rule amendments may affect economic efficiency through changes in disclosure and advertising content. these increases in efficiency and related cost reductions could manifest as a higher likelihood that investors make use of the disclosures that funds provide through their shareholder reports and advertising materials, and thus lead to investment decisions that are more informationally efficient.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: see supra section iv.c.1; richard e. nisbett & lee ross, human inference: strategies and shortcomings of social, nisbett & ross (prentice hall 1980); hirshleifer and teoh study, supra footnote 640. the commission could also have adopted rule amendments that provide funds with alternatives to transmitting the semi-annual report, such as by permitting the requirement to transmit semi-annual reports to be satisfied by a fund filing certain information on form n-csr or by making information available on a website (either semi-annually or more frequently). funds also could have experienced lower costs associated with preparing disclosures, particularly if the information they were required to provide on websites largely replicated information that many funds already provide online in monthly or quarterly fact sheets.\\756\\ shareholders could have benefitted from these cost savings to the extent funds pass them through. in addition, to the extent we permitted this approach to be optional for the fund (e.g., funds could either provide certain information online or transmit semi-annual reports), the alternative may have led to shareholders in some funds receiving less direct information than those in other funds. \\756\\ see generally supra section ii.e.3. relative to the rule amendments, funds would have benefitted from the cost savings associated with no longer being required to transmit the semi-annual report.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: in addition, the commission could have adopted an access equals delivery approach as an alternative to the shareholder report delivery approach we are adopting.\\758\\ the effect of an access equals delivery approach would be that funds would post their streamlined shareholder reports online, without the notice that rule 30e-3 currently requires, rather than delivering them by email or postal mail to fund shareholders and their households. \\760\\ see supra section ii.e.2. one benefit of this approach that commenters raised involved the potential for a cost reduction (which would be passed on to fund shareholders).\\759\\ as discussed above, commenters discussing this approach raise considerations for any future initiative on the delivery of fund regulatory materials.\\760\\ we anticipate that any further initiative on the delivery of fund regulatory materials would address these considerations.\\761\\ \\758\\ see, e.g., capital group comment letter (urging adoption of an access equals delivery approach for shareholder reports and annual prospectus updates); tiaa comment letter (urging an incremental approach, focusing first on the format and substance of shareholder reports, urging the adoption of access equals delivery with respect to all disclosure documents); t. rowe price comment letter (recommending access equals delivery for semi-annual shareholder reports). \\757\\ see supra sections iv.c.2.a.ii and iv.c.2.b.iii (discussing our belief that the proposed shareholder reports could be trifold self-mailers). \\759\\ see, e.g., capital group comment letter, federated hermes comment letter, tiaa comment letter, t. rowe price comment letter.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: the treasury department and the irs recommend that taxpayers consult form 3468, investment credit, and form 3800, general business credit, and those form's accompanying instructions, as well as the current version of publication 5884, inflation reduction act (ira) and chips act of 2022 (chips) pre-filing registration tool user guide and instructions, for the latest guidance on the pre-filing registration process. similarly, the final regulations provide the time and manner for making an elective payment election that is consistent with the existing framework for claiming business tax credits; that is, the filing of the annual return including the completed source credit form and completed form 3800. as previously noted, the pre-filing registration process has been designed to help prevent fraud and duplication, while also allowing for more efficient processing and payment upon filing of the return. 1.48d-6(b)(5) would require a taxpayer to obtain a registration number for each qualified investment in an advanced manufacturing facility as a prerequisite to making an elective payment election with respect to the section 48d credit determined with respect to such qualified investment for the taxable year. 1.48d-6(b)(5) would require a taxpayer to obtain a registration number for each qualified investment in an advanced manufacturing facility of an eligible taxpayer with respect to which an elective payment election is made. a rule allowing a taxpayer to register a single advanced manufacturing facility project, which could include multiple qualified investments in more than one advanced manufacturing facility, would create an administrative burden on the irs because the determination of the section 48d credits with respect to the separate facilities could be different.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the commenter asked whether a missed registration for a portion of a qualified investment will impact a taxpayer's ability to make an election for the portion of the qualified investment for which registration was properly made and whether a taxpayer may claim a section 48d credit for the portion for which the registration was not properly made. this treasury decision therefore adopts those proposed regulations as final regulations. as of february 2024, publication 5884 states: even though registration is not possible prior to the beginning of the tax year in which the credit will be earned, the irs recommends that taxpayers register as soon as reasonably practicable during the tax year. instead, the treasury department and the irs recommend that taxpayers consult the current version of publication 5884 for the latest guidance on the pre-filing registration process. this is a factual matter that cannot be addressed in these final regulations as it depends on the facts and circumstances of the qualified investment made by the taxpayer.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: as the elective payment election results in a section 48d credit being treated as tax exempt income rather than a credit, it is inappropriate to adopt a rule allowing the partners to treat the same amount as a credit for estimated tax purposes. commenters also requested that the irs should be required to process the elective payment within 45 days from the date the election is filed, similar to the quick refund process under form 4466, corporation application for quick refund of overpayment of estimated tax. thus, the final regulations do not adopt the commenter's recommendation of a rule allowing corporate (or any other) partners to reduce quarterly estimated taxes for section 48d credits determined with respect to property held through a partnership that makes an elective payment election. for the same reasons, the section 48d credit may not be included to calculate estimated tax for form 4466, which, under section 6425(a)(1) of the code must be filed after the close of a corporation's taxable year, on or before the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of such taxable year, and prior to the filing of the corporation's return for such taxable year. instead, section 48d(d)(2)(a) provides that if a partnership makes an elective payment election, any elective payment amount is treated as tax exempt income for purposes of section 705 and a partner's distributive share of such tax exempt income is equal to such partner's distributive share of the section 48d credit otherwise available for each taxable year.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the investment credit under section 46 is a business credit under section 38(b)(1). the treasury department and the irs are aware that taxpayers may have entered into written binding partnership agreements for the joint ownership and operation of an advanced manufacturing facility or qualified property in anticipation of the enactment of the chips act on august 9, 2022. other taxpayers may have entered into such written binding partnership agreements on or after august 9, 2022, and before publication of the proposed regulations under section 48d(d) in the federal register on june 21, 2023. the treasury department and the irs are also aware that such taxpayers may have made erroneous assumptions in their partnership agreements concerning the allocation of the tax exempt income described in section 48d(d)(2)(a)(i)(iii), and, more specifically, that such tax exempt income could be allocated otherwise than as provided in section 48d(d)(2)(a)(i)(iv). the treasury department and the irs have determined, however, that an interim rule allowing partnerships that meet certain requirements to determine a partner's distributive share of the tax exempt income resulting from an elective payment election in accordance with the basic principles governing partnership income allocations under the section 704(b) regulations, instead of in accordance with the principles under the section 704(b) regulations and sec. the treasury department and the irs have determined that a general rule in the final regulations that would allow a partnership to determine a partner's distributive share of the tax exempt income described in section 48d(d)(2)(a)(i)(iii) without regard to section 48d(d)(2)(a)(i)(iv) is inconsistent with the language in section 48d(d)(2)(a)(i)(iv) and the structure and the purpose of the statute. in determining the amount of the section 48d credit that will result in a payment to the partnership or s corporation under section 48d(d)(2)(a)(i)(i) and in sec.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the treasury department and the irs note that the final regulations revise and include new examples in sec. thus, the final regulations adopt the rule as proposed. but, the revisions also require a taxpayer to use the section 48d credit as a current year gbc to the extent that it is necessary to reduce tax liability up to the limitation under section 38(c). several commenters requested that the final regulations not include the section 38 ordering rule in proposed sec. therefore, this treasury decision adopts the proposed rules as final regulations.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: pursuant to the memorandum of agreement, review of treasury regulations under executive order 12866 (june 9, 2023), tax regulatory actions issued by the irs are not subject to the requirements of section 6 of executive order 12866, as amended. therefore, a regulatory impact assessment is not required.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: these final regulations also mention reporting requirements related to making elections and calculating the section 48d credit amount as detailed in sec. these elections will be made by eligible taxpayers as part of filing a return (such as the appropriate form 1040, form 1120, form 1120-s, or form 1065); and credit calculations will be made on form 3800 and supporting forms. these final regulations mention the reporting requirements to complete pre-filing registration with the irs to be able to make an elective payment election in sec. the reporting of a recapture event will still be required to be reported using form 4255, recapture of investment credit. this form is approved under 1545-0074 for individuals and 1545-0123 for business entities.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: these final regulations provide the manner for making an elective payment election which includes the filing of the annual return including the completed source credit form and completed form 3800. these final regulations also provide that taxpayers wanting to make the elective payment election must complete the pre-filing registration process and provide the rules relating to the pre-filing registration process. section 48d(d) allows such taxpayers to make an elective payment election to treat the section 48d credit as a refundable payment against the income tax in lieu of claiming the credit. section 48d is an investment credit for taxpayers that make qualified investments in advanced manufacturing facilities the primary purpose of which is manufacturing semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. the deputy chief counsel for advocacy, small business administration, recommended that the treasury department and the irs provide a statement of the factual basis for the certification that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities including, at a minimum, a description of the affected entities, and provide the economic impact that the rules would have on small entities including estimates of the costs of reading and understanding the rules and any reporting and recordkeeping requirements. the reporting and recordkeeping requirements associated with the elective payment election is not likely to be significant because they are consistent with the existing framework for claiming business tax credits absent of an election.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: section 202 of the unfunded mandate reform act of 1995 requires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits and take certain other actions before issuing a final rule that includes any federal mandate that may result in expenditures in any one year by a state, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million in 1995 dollars (updated annually for inflation). these final regulations do not include any federal mandate that may result in expenditures by state, local, or tribal governments, or by the private sector in excess of that threshold. executive order 13132: federalism executive order 13132 (federalism) prohibits an agency from publishing any rule that has federalism implications if the rule either imposes substantial, direct compliance costs on state and local governments, and is not required by statute, or preempts state law, unless the agency meets the consultation and funding requirements of section 6 of the executive order. these final regulations do not have federalism implications and do not impose substantial, direct compliance costs on state and local governments or preempt state law within the meaning of the executive order. vi.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: the final regulations largely adopt the rules suggested in the preamble to the separate notice of proposed rulemaking published in the federal register on august 5, 2020 (85 fr 47508). because such excess is generally not imputed income for federal income tax purposes and a deduction for the afs interest expense is generally not imputed for federal income tax purposes, it is necessary to adjust afs revenue to prevent the improper acceleration, or overreporting, of gross income. a. realization and recognition as noted in the preamble to the proposed section 451(b) regulations, footnote 872 of the conference report to the tcja states that section 451(b) was not intended to revise the rules associated with when an item is realized for federal income tax purposes and does not require the recognition of income in situations where the federal income tax realization event has not taken place. the commenter recommended that, if the final regulations use the afs to measure the receipt of an economic benefit, then the final regulations also should reflect the afs standards that require certain items of income be reported ``net'' of offsetting items. one commenter agreed that section 451(b) was not intended to affect the application of the general oid timing rules to oid other than for certain fees that are not treated as discount for afs purposes, including the specified credit card fees.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: specifically, section 451(b)(3)(b) provides that a financial statement made on the basis of ifrs is an afs for section 451(b) if the financial statement is filed with a foreign government agency that is equivalent to the united states securities and exchange commission (sec) and has financial reporting standards not less stringent than the standards imposed by the sec. the commenter questioned whether the requirement in section 451(b)(3)(b) that the financial reporting standards of a foreign agency or government be not less stringent than the standards required by the sec, refers solely to reporting standards related to revenue or if it also refers to reporting standards for other items that are not related to revenue. if the sale has not occurred, and the right to the future payments is extinguished if the customer cancels the contract, the afs income inclusion rule does not require acceleration because there is no enforceable right to the future payments if the contract is cancelled by the customer provided that the taxpayer is not using the alternative afs revenue method in sec. if a sale has occurred under the facts and circumstances, any income resulting from the sale is realized under section 1001 and the right to the income is fixed, therefore the afs income inclusion rule does not result in the acceleration of afs revenue. at this time, however, the treasury department and the irs decline to adopt the book pcm option set forth by commenters because of the concerns raised regarding the complexity and the desire by some taxpayers to obtain more beneficial timing under tax rules when using a book pcm method.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the recommended rule is more restrictive than the rule in the proposed regulation which requires the payment to be received in a taxable year earlier than the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year of the contractual delivery date. the same commenter also suggested that if the definition of the contractual delivery date was broadened, the requirement regarding the period of time between when an advance payment is received and the delivery date for a specified good could be modified to require that the expected delivery date occur more than 24 months after the advance payment is received. the treasury department and the irs decline to adopt the comments to broaden the definition of contractual delivery date in the final regulations because the suggested approaches would decrease administrability and increase uncertainty for taxpayers and the potential for litigation. accordingly, the treasury department and the irs decline to adopt this recommendation. 1. contractual delivery date requirement some commenters generally requested that the treasury department and the irs re-examine the contractual delivery date requirement.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the final regulations also provide a similar allocation rule for taxpayers using the non-afs deferral method. however, based on section 451(b) and the final regulations, revenue procedure 2004-33, revenue procedure 2005- 47, and chief counsel notice cc-2010-018 no longer provide current guidance on the treatment of the specified credit card fees. 1.451-5(c) permitted a cost offset for both incurred and estimated costs against certain advance payments that were required to be included in gross income in a taxable year prior to the year in which ownership of the item of inventory was transferred to the customer, and was recently withdrawn in final regulations published in the federal register on july 15, 2019. see h.r. this rule is consistent with the requirement in section 451(c)(4)(d) that ``rules similar to the rules in [section 451](b)(4) shall apply,'' because it follows the manner in which the taxpayer allocates the payment for afs purposes. the payment for the commission income is an advance payment because it meets the definition of an advance payment under section 451(c)(4), including the requirement that a portion of the payment is included in the taxpayer's revenue in an afs for a subsequent taxable year.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: a. need for the final regulations the tax cuts and jobs act (tcja) substantially modified the statutory rules of section 451, which generally governs when income is recognized for federal tax purposes. the timing of income recognition for tax purposes may also deviate from the all-events test in certain circumstances. thus, this new rule requires taxpayers to recognize income upon the earlier of when the all-events test is met or when the taxpayer includes the amount in revenue (broadly defined) in its afs (afs income inclusion rule). the amended section 451(b) more closely aligns when income is recognized for federal tax purposes with when it is recognized on businesses' financial accounting statements. both the u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and the international financial reporting standards (ifrs) provide income recognition rules that differ from tax reporting rules under certain circumstances.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the proposed regulations noted that the economic analysis of the final regulations under section 451(c) would address the economic effects of regulatory guidance, if any, under sections 460 and 461(h) or other sections of the code that interact with section 451(c), that was issued between the proposed and final regulations. 1.451-3 affect only those business entities that (i) use an accrual method of accounting, and (ii) have an afs. the treasury department and the irs recognize that some taxpayers may take advantage of favorable provisions in the final regulations and that this decision could increase their compliance costs. regarding the accrual method of accounting, section 13102 of tcja modified section 448 to expand the number of taxpayers eligible to use the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting (cash method of accounting). the treasury department and the irs have also not made projections of any change in compliance costs arising from the final regulations, relative to the no-action baseline.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: taxpayers needing to make method changes pursuant to these regulations will be required to file a form 3115. the treasury department and the irs have provided streamlined procedures for certain taxpayers to change their method of accounting to comply with section 451(b) and (c), and plan to provide streamlined procedures for such taxpayers to change to the methods of accounting described in these regulations. pursuant to section 7805(f), the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding this final rule was submitted to the chief counsel for the office of advocacy of the small business administration for comment on its impact on small business. under the streamlined procedures, eligible taxpayers would either complete only a portion of the form 3115 or would not complete the form 3115 at all to comply with the guidance. these regulations provide general guidance on the rules, including the scope of the rules, exceptions to the rules, definitions of key terms, and examples demonstrating applicability of the rules. section 451(b) requires that an item of income be included in gross income for tax purposes no later than when the item is counted as revenue in an afs.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: section 202 of the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 (umra) requires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits and take certain actions before issuing a final rule that includes any federal mandate that may result in expenditures in any one year by a state, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private section, of $100 million in 1995 dollars, update annually for inflation. this rule does not include any federal mandate that may result in expenditures by state, local, or tribal governments, or by the private section in excess of that threshold. v. executive order 13132: federalism executive order 13132 (entitled ``federalism'') prohibits an agency from publishing any rule that has federalism implications if the rule either imposes substantial, direct compliance costs on state and local governments, and is not required by statute, or preempts state law, unless the agency meets the consultation and funding requirements of section 6 of the executive order. this final rule does not have federalism implications and does not impose substantial direct compliance costs on state and local governments or preempt state law within the meaning of the executive order.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: a. background prior to the tax cuts and jobs act (tcja), section 162(f) of the code disallowed a deduction for any fine or similar penalty paid to a government for the violation of any law. section 13306(a) also provides certain exceptions to this disallowance. the general rule of section 162(f)(1), as amended by section 13306(a) of the tcja, disallows any deduction for amounts paid or incurred (whether by suit, agreement, or otherwise) to, or at the direction of, a government or governmental entity or certain nongovernmental entities treated as governmental entities, in relation to the violation of any law or the investigation or inquiry by such government or entity into the potential violation of any law. section 162(f)(2)(a)(i) and (ii) does not disallow deduction for amounts that (1) the taxpayer establishes were paid or incurred as restitution (including remediation of property) or to come into compliance with a law, and (2) are identified in the court order or settlement agreement as restitution, remediation, or to come into compliance with a law. this provision, enacted in 1969, codified existing case law that denied business deductions for fines or similar penalties.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: d. baseline in this analysis, the treasury department and the irs assess the benefits and costs of the final regulations relative to a no-action baseline reflecting anticipated federal income tax-related behavior in the absence of these regulations. the regulations provide guidance regarding sections 162(f) and 6050x. e. economic analysis of the regulation describes the economic effects of specific provisions covering (1) the reporting threshold, (2) the timing of information reporting, and (3) information reporting requirements when payment amounts are not identified. the following analysis provides further detail regarding the anticipated impacts of the regulations.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the regulations also clarify (1) how the taxpayer meets the establishment requirement; and (2) how the order or agreement meets the identification requirement. the treasury department and the irs have determined that the burden reduction associated with the regulations for section 162(f) is modest. in addition, while the regulations reduce uncertainty for taxpayers, they are unlikely to affect economic decision-making because most of the amounts to be paid or incurred which are subject to section 162(f) are non-discretionary. the regulations under section 162(f) provide definitions for restitution, remediation, and amounts paid to come into compliance with the law. the regulations under section 6050x provide certainty and consistency for affected governments and governmental entities by defining and clarifying the statute's terms and rules.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: however, to increase the likelihood that payors have the information necessary to timely prepare their income tax returns, the final regulations still require governments and governmental entities to furnish the written statements to payors on or before january 31 of such year. section 6050x also provides the secretary with the authority to adjust the statutory reporting threshold as necessary to ensure efficient tax administration. \\1\\ this data point is derived by the irs as part of the burden analysis described in the paperwork reduction act section below. furthermore, firms with less than $10 million in assets are not required to provide financial reporting values with their tax returns. as requested, the final regulations are revised to provide that information returns filed with the irs on paper are due on or before february 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the order or agreement becomes binding under applicable law and information returns filed electronically are due on or before march 31 of such year.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: \\25\\ fasb asc paragraph 718-10-30-6. fasb asc paragraph 718-10- 30-1 states that this guidance applies equally to awards classified as liabilities. the staff is providing guidance in the following sections related to the expected volatility, expected term and current share price assumptions to assist public entities in applying those requirements. fasb asc topic 718's (compensation--stock compensation topic) fair value measurement objective for equity instruments awarded to grantees for goods or services is to estimate the grant-date fair value of the equity instruments that the entity is obligated to issue when grantees have delivered the good or rendered the service and satisfied any other conditions necessary to earn the right to benefit from the instruments.\\25\\ in order to meet this fair value measurement objective, management will generally be required to develop estimates regarding (1) the expected volatility of its company's share price; (2) the expected term of the option, taking into account both the contractual term of the option and the effects of grantees' expected exercise and post-vesting termination behavior; and (3) the determination of the current price of the underlying share.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: when circumstances indicate the availability of new or different information that would be useful in estimating expected volatility, a company should incorporate that information. the staff believes that companies should make good faith efforts to identify and use sufficient information in determining whether taking historical volatility, implied volatility or a combination of both into account will result in the best estimate of expected volatility. question 2: what should company b consider if computing historical volatility? \\31\\ the staff believes implied volatility derived from embedded options can be utilized in determining expected volatility if, in deriving the implied volatility, the company considers all relevant features of the instruments (e.g., value of the host instrument, value of the option, etc.). the extent of the ultimate reliance on implied volatility will depend on a company's facts and circumstances; however, the staff believes that a company with actively traded options or other financial instruments with embedded options \\31\\ generally could place greater (or even exclusive) reliance on implied volatility.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: certain methods may not be appropriate for longer term share options if they weight the most recent periods of company b's historical volatility much more heavily than earlier periods.\\34\\ for example, a method that applies a factor to certain historical price intervals to reflect a decay or loss of relevance of that historical information emphasizes the most recent historical periods and thus would likely bias the estimate to this recent history.\\35\\ \\33\\ for purposes of this staff accounting bulletin, the phrase ``expected or contractual term, as applicable'' has the same meaning as the phrase ``expected (if using a black-scholes-merton closed- form model) or contractual (if using a lattice model) term of a share option.'' the staff believes the method selected by company b to compute its historical volatility should produce an estimate that is representative of a marketplace participant's expectations about company b's future volatility over the expected (if using a black-scholes-merton closed- form model) or contractual (if using a lattice model) term \\33\\ of its share options. company b would not be precluded from using historical data longer than six years if it concludes that data would be relevant. the staff believes company b could utilize a period of historical data longer than the expected or contractual term, as applicable, if it reasonably believes the additional historical information will improve the estimate. for example, assume company b decided to utilize a black-scholes-merton closed-form model to estimate the value of the share options granted on january 2, 20x6 and determined that the expected term was six years.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: for example, if company b has recently announced a merger with a company that would change its business risk in the future, then it should consider the impact of the merger in estimating the expected volatility if it reasonably believes a marketplace participant would also consider this event. 4. consideration of future events-- the objective in estimating expected volatility is to ascertain the assumptions that marketplace participants would likely use in determining an exchange price for an option.\\38\\ accordingly, the staff believes that company b should consider those future events that it reasonably concludes a marketplace participant would also consider in making the estimation. \\37\\ fasb asc paragraph 718-10-55-40 states that a company should establish a process for estimating expected volatility and apply that process consistently from period to period. \\39\\ fasb asc paragraph 718-10-55-13 states ``assumptions shall reflect information that is (or would be) available to form the basis for an amount at which the instruments being valued would be exchanged. in addition, fasb asc paragraph 718-10-55-27 indicates that assumptions used to estimate the fair value of instruments granted in share-based payment transactions should be determined in a consistent manner from period to period.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: this measurement should also be synchronized with the grant of the share options; however, when this is not reasonably practicable, the staff believes company b should derive implied volatility as of a point in time as close to the grant of the share options as reasonably practicable. company b should synchronize the variables used to derive implied volatility. for example, to the extent reasonably practicable, company b should use market prices (either traded prices or the average of bid and asked quotes) of the traded options and its shares measured at the same point in time.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: other examples may include, but are not limited to, the introduction of a new product that is central to a company's business model or the receipt of u.s. food and drug administration approval for the sale of a new prescription drug. the objective of estimating volatility, as stated in fasb asc topic 718, is to ascertain the assumption about expected volatility that marketplace participants would likely use in determining an exchange price for an option.\\47\\ the staff believes that a company, after considering the factors listed in fasb asc topic 718, could, in certain situations, reasonably conclude that exclusive reliance on either historical or implied volatility would provide an estimate of expected volatility that meets this stated objective. 5. consideration of material nonpublic information-- when a company is in possession of material non-public information, the staff believes that the related guidance in the interpretive response to question 2 above would also be relevant in determining whether the implied volatility appropriately reflects a marketplace participant's expectations of future volatility. in addition, company b should consider the requirements of regulation s-k item 303(b)(3) regarding critical accounting estimates in md&a. question 5: what disclosures would the staff expect company b to include in its financial statements and md&a regarding its assumption of expected volatility?\n",

            "🔹 Summary: 34-47986, june 5, 2003, management's report on internal control over financial reporting and certification of disclosure in exchange act period reports. company k should establish appropriate controls surrounding the calculation and recording of this period end adjustment, as it would any other period end adjustment. the fact that the entry is recorded as a period end adjustment, by itself, should not impact management's ability to determine that the internal control over financial reporting, as defined by the sec's rules implementing section 404 of the sarbanes- oxley act of 2002,\\86\\ is effective. as such, company k is required to initially capitalize the cost of the share option grants to these production employees as inventory and later recognize the cost in the income statement when the inventory is consumed.\\85\\ \\85\\ fasb asc paragraph 718-10-25-2a. facts: company k is a manufacturing company that grants share options to its production employees.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: 4160 also indicates that the payment by principal stockholders of a company's debt should be accounted for as a capital contribution. the transactions for which fasb asc topic 850 requires disclosure generally are those in which a company receives goods or services directly from, or provides goods or services directly to, a related party, and the form and terms of such transactions may be structured to produce either a direct or indirect benefit to the related party. 2021-26027 filed 11-30-21; 8:45 am] billing code p as explained in this paragraph, the substance of such a transaction is that the economic interest holder makes a capital contribution to the reporting entity, and the reporting entity makes a share-based payment to its grantee in exchange for goods or services provided to the reporting entity. the staff believes that the substance of such transactions is the payment of an expense of the company through contributions by the stockholder.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: in addition, the treasury department and the irs have determined that revising the election to provide that it remains in effect until revoked would reduce the risk to taxpayers of inadvertently failing to include the election with their federal income tax return. the final regulations also retain, with certain modifications, the rules for determining the portion of gross income from sales and production activities under sec. 1.864-5, 1.864-6, and 1.864-7 also continue to apply in determining whether foreign source income from the sale of inventory by nonresident aliens, who would be residents under section 865(g)(1)(a), is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states. 1.882-4 and 1.882-5. since those regulations apply only to foreign corporations, one comment requested that the final regulations also refer to sec. the final regulations also revise sec.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: specifically, the comment expressed concern that treating income from the sale of inventory produced, in whole or in part, in the united states as u.s. source income might result in double taxation if the income is also subject to tax in a foreign jurisdiction, since the u.s. source income would be excluded from the numerator of the section 904 limitation, reducing the section 904 limitation, and potentially limiting the u.s. taxpayer's ability to use its foreign tax credits. 1.863-3(c)(3)) already applies to make appropriate adjustments where taxpayers enter into or structure certain transactions with a principal purpose of reducing u.s. tax liability under sec. to clarify the application of this rule, the final regulations provide that the anti-abuse rule applies to transactions inconsistent with the purpose of sec. 1.863-3(b) or (c), and adds as an example that the anti-abuse rule may cover acquisitions of domestic production assets by related partnerships (or subsidiaries thereof) with a principal purpose of reducing the transferor's u.s. tax liability by treating income from the sale of inventory property as subject to section 862(a)(6) rather than section 863(b). 1.863-3(c)(1)(i)) provides the rule for sourcing of income where production occurs only within the united states or only within foreign countries.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: these regulations do not affect the ability of a taxpayer to rely on treaty provisions to mitigate or relieve double taxation, including treaty provisions that permit a taxpayer to make a request to the competent authority for assistance pursuant to a mutual agreement procedure article of an applicable income tax treaty. see 84 fr 71836, 71844. one comment supported the preamble's statement and requested that, consistent with the statement in the preamble, the final regulations not apply to section 863(b)(2) sales in a manner that results in double taxation to u.s. taxpayers engaged in business operations through a permanent establishment in a treaty jurisdiction, notwithstanding the act's change to section 863(b). 1.865-3 interacted with u.s. income tax treaties under which the business profits of foreign treaty residents may be taxable in the united states only if the profits are attributable to a permanent establishment in the united states. the comment also requested that competent authority relief be provided in this regard. the preamble to the proposed regulations stated, ``[w]ith respect to taxpayers entitled to the benefits of an income tax treaty, the amount of profits attributable to a u.s. permanent establishment will not be affected by these regulations.''\n",

            "🔹 Summary: the commission believes that this condition is important to facilitate immediate notice to market participants--including retail investors--that an issuer's information is no longer current and publicly available, timely filed, or filed within 180 calendar days from the specified period, as applicable.\\367\\ \\365\\ this requirement is measured from the end of the issuer's most recent fiscal year or any quarterly reporting period that is covered by a report required by exchange act section 13 or 15(d), as applicable. the commission has determined to adopt the proposed amendment to eliminate the 12-business-days frequency of quotation requirement because technological advances that have taken place since this provision was adopted have obviated the need for it, given that it is now easier for broker-dealers to continuously update and widely disseminate quotations and information about issuers to investors.\\356\\ as suggested by commenters, the commission has also determined to eliminate the 30-calendar-day window from the frequency of quotation requirement in the amended rule. the qualified idqs or registered national securities association must make such subsequent publicly available determination within the first four business days that such documents and information are no longer current and publicly available, timely filed, or filed within 180 calendar days.\\368\\ to ensure the wide availability of such notice to market participants, the commission strongly encourages, and commission staff intends to offer assistance and support to,\\369\\ qualified idqss and the registered national securities association to establish a means to tag, or otherwise provide freely available public indication of notice, that an issuer's paragraph (b) information is no longer current and publicly available, and that, as a result, the security has entered the 15-calendar-day grace period before it is ineligible to maintain its quoted market through reliance on the piggyback exception. 6. grace period--rule 15c2-11(f)(3)(ii) the commission posed a question in the proposing release about whether the piggyback exception should include a grace period during which a broker-dealer could continue to publish or submit quotations following the expiration of the proposed six-month period specified in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of the proposed rule.\\359\\ the commission inquired about the length of such a grace period and the role of an idqs or the use of tags to identify quotations for any security of an issuer if its information has not been made publicly available within a specified time frame. \\358\\ the amended rule does not impose any limit on the number of broker-dealers that are permitted to publish quotations for a security after a qualified idqs makes a publicly available determination to allow the initiation for a quoted market.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the expansion of the list of specified locations under the amended rule to include the websites of state and federal agencies accommodates state and federal agency websites that routinely make paragraph (b) information available to the public (e.g., the federal deposit insurance corporation's website, which makes information about certain insured depositary institutions, including community banks, available for viewing by the public).\\488\\ in addition, the expansion of the list to include an electronic information delivery system that is generally available to the public in the primary trading market of a foreign private issuer,\\489\\ as defined in rule 3b-4 of the exchange act, aligns the definition of publicly available in the amended rule with exchange act rule 12g3-2(b) and is appropriate because paragraph (b) information regarding an exempt foreign private issuer must, among other things, be publicly available for purposes of compliance with the information review requirement, reliance on an exception, or making a publicly available determination before a broker-dealer can publish a quotation for an exempt foreign private issuer's security. \\489\\ see exemption from registration under section 12(g) of the securities exchange act of 1934 for foreign private issuers, exchange act release no. the information that, since the first day of its most recently completed fiscal year, the issuer has published as required to establish the exemption from registration under section 12(g) of the exchange act pursuant to exchange act rule 12g3-2(b); \\461\\ and \\461\\ see amended rule 15c2-11(b)(4). the commission is including technical edits to paragraph (b)(4) of the amended rule to align the amended rule with exchange act rule 12g3-2(b), which refers to information required to be published for the foreign private issuer to avail itself of an exemption from registration under section 12(g) of the exchange act. the commenter suggested the following for the commission to ``more effectively address these issues outside the scope of the rule, in large part by requiring additional disclosure from powerful market participants'': (1) affiliates, insiders, and paid promoters should not be afforded the ability to hide their positions in anonymous objecting beneficial owner accounts; (2) disclosure of transaction information for officers and affiliates of non-reporting issuers should be required in a manner similar to forms 3, 4, and 5; (3) institutions should be required to disclose their holdings in non-exchange listed securities under exchange act section 13(f); (4) securities act section 17(b) should be amended to require additional disclosure from paid stock promoters; and (5) transfer agent regulations should be updated to require disclosure of share issuance and transfer information, and broker-dealers should be permitted to rely on this information in facilitating transactions in restricted and control securities.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: (citing the filing and disclosure release, which notes that section 13(d)'s legislative history indicates that the purpose of that section is ``to provide information to the public and the affected issuer about rapid accumulations of its equity securities'' by ``persons who would then have the potential to change or influence control of the issuer. the commission also proposed three notes to rule 13d-3(e) that would have clarified the application of the proposed rule's formula. (noting that ``the concept `purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer' is a familiar one under regulation 13d-g, both in the context of determining whether a person is a beneficial owner under rule 13d-3 and for purposes of determining whether a beneficial owner is eligible to report on schedule 13g in lieu of schedule 13d under rule 13d-1''). at 13863-64. in proposing rule 13d-3(e), the commission noted that non-sbs cash- settled derivative securities held with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing control of the issuer may be used to influence the voting, acquisition, or disposition of any shares the holder's counterparty may have acquired in a hedge, proprietary investment, or otherwise.\\448\\ the commission also stated that a non-sbs cash-settled derivative holder's probability of success in exerting influence or control over the issuer of the reference security may increase given that any voting power the derivative holder held would be magnified by minimizing the number of shares that potentially could be voted against the holder's plans or proposals.\\449\\ finally, the commission recognized that holders of non-sbs cash-settled derivative securities may position themselves to acquire any reference securities that the counterparty may acquire to hedge the economic risk of that transaction.\\450\\ the commission also noted that holders of non-sbs cash-settled derivative securities may present their economic positions to persuade an issuer or its shareholders to engage with them.\\451\\ the commission concluded, therefore, that these persons' holdings of non- sbs cash-settled derivative securities may implicate the policies underlying section 13(d).\\452\\ \\448\\ id. the commission acknowledged the possibility that derivative counterparties may have a business relationship to develop and protect, and thus may ultimately cast votes in accordance with the preference of the derivative holder or not vote the shares.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: bishop and partnoy ii (stating that, under existing rule 13d-3, holders of cash-settled derivative securities may be subject to regulation as beneficial owners of the reference equity securities in applicable circumstances, and recommending that the commission not adopt proposed rule 13d-3(e) but instead issue ``guidance on cash-settled derivatives'' and ``articulat[e] how the commission's current rules continue to prohibit problematic conduct related to the [proposing release]''). first, under rule 13d-3(a), to the extent a non-sbs cash-settled derivative security provides its holder, directly or indirectly, with exclusive or shared voting or investment power, within the meaning of that rule, over the reference covered class through a contractual term of the derivative security or otherwise, the holder of that derivative security may become a beneficial owner of the reference covered class. second, to the extent a non-sbs cash-settled derivative security is acquired with the purpose or effect of divesting its holder of beneficial ownership of the reference covered class or preventing the vesting of that beneficial ownership as part of a plan or scheme to evade the reporting requirements of section 13(d) or 13(g), the derivative security may be viewed as a contract, arrangement, or device within the meaning of those terms as used in rule 13d-3(b). finally, under rule 13d-3(d)(1), a person is deemed a beneficial owner of an equity security if the person (1) has a right to acquire beneficial ownership of the equity security within 60 days or (2) acquires the right to acquire beneficial ownership of the equity security with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer of the security for which the right is exercisable, or in connection with or as a participant in any transaction having such purpose or effect, regardless of when the right is exercisable.\\478\\ as the commission stated in the security-based swaps release, rule 13d-3(d)(1) applies regardless of the origin of the right to acquire the equity security.\\479\\ if such a right originates in a derivative security that is nominally ``cash-settled'' or from an understanding in connection with that derivative security, rule 13d- 3(d)(1) would apply. \\475\\ see letter from iaa; see also letter from profs.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: in addition, the commission proposed to amend rule 13d-5 to include new paragraph (b)(1)(ii). \\543\\ in addition to the guidance set forth in this section, we provide additional guidance in section ii.d.3 in connection with the discussion regarding our final disposition of the proposed exemptions under rule 13d-6. the commission also proposed new rule 13d- 5(b)(2)(i), which would contain nearly identical language to proposed rule 13d-5(b)(1)(i), with conforming changes to address circumstances in which two or more persons act as a group under section 13(g)(3) and the group is deemed to become the beneficial owner of all of the equity securities of a covered class beneficially owned by each of the group's members as of the date on which the group is formed. upon consideration of the comments received, we believe that the better approach is not to adopt the proposed amendment to rule 13d-5 but instead to provide guidance as to the application of the existing legal standard established in sections 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3) with respect to the formation of a group.\\543\\ \\540\\ see proposing release at 13869. in response to some of the concerns raised by commenters, we provide guidance below on the application of the current legal standard found in section 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3) to certain common types of shareholder engagement activities.\\557\\ \\557\\ each illustration assumes that the rules adopted in this release are in effect and that the securities of the subject company are in a covered class.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: e. amendment to schedule 13d to clarify disclosure requirements regarding derivative securities schedule 13d sets forth the information that beneficial owners reporting pursuant to section 13(d)(1) and rule 13d-1(a) must disclose. accordingly, we have elected not to adopt proposed rule 13d-6(d) as the exemption is not needed in order for such ordinary course of business transactions in derivative securities to freely occur. we also believe that the discussion and guidance we provided in section ii.c.1.c above will help to address the commission's goals of preserving shareholder communications and engagement with issuers that are undertaken without the purpose or effect of changing or influencing control. further, as discussed below, the current requirement could be interpreted as excluding the disclosure of cash-settled options not offered or sold by the issuer, or other derivatives not originating with the issuer, including other cash-settled derivatives such as sbs. similarly, after considering the comments received regarding proposed rule 13d-6(d),\\617\\ we also do not believe adoption of that exemption is necessary.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: other commenters opposed the proposed amendment to item 6 of schedule 13d, stating that requiring disclosure of sbs arrangements in item 6 would be confusing and indicating that it did not believe this disclosure would serve any additional purpose.\\625\\ one commenter explained that determining which type of derivative security to include in different parts of schedule 13d would present a logistical challenge.\\626\\ the commenter anticipated that the compliance-related challenge would arise, from an operational point of view, because of the regulatory inconsistency created by the exclusion of sbs from the beneficial ownership calculation under proposed rule 13d-3(e) but the inclusion of sbs under item 6 (to the extent they use the issuer's equity security as a reference security).\\627\\ the commenter expressed additional concern that requiring disclosure of sbs arrangements under item 6 would negate the benefits to these holders of non-disclosure of counterparties in proposed schedule 10b.\\628\\ \\625\\ see, e.g., letters from iaa; slade thornburg (june 25, 2023) (``s. thornburg''). the commission proposed this disclosure statement in a proposing release titled prohibition against fraud, manipulation, or deception in connection with security-based swaps; prohibition against undue influence over chief compliance officers; position reporting of large security-based swap positions, release no. the commenter also stated that the filing of such instruments as exhibits would present logistical difficulties if the proposed ``compressed'' timeframes for reporting schedule 13d amendments are adopted. would not require identification of the swap counterparty'' while ``the instruction to item 6 requires `naming the persons with whom such contracts, arrangements, understandings, or relationships have been entered into.''' according to the commenter, ``[n]ot only would this be confusing, but we do not believe such disclosure would serve any additional purpose.''\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the commenter also noted that the proposed amendment to item 6 would be unnecessary in light of, and could conflict with, the disclosure of sbs positions in proposed rule 10b-1.\\636\\ while the commission will consider concerns about a potential conflict if it takes any final action with respect to proposed rule 10b-1, we note that proposed rule 10b-1 (along with proposed schedule 10b) is intended to serve a purpose different from item 6 of schedule 13d. \\641\\ examples include the section 16 beneficial ownership reports (forms 3, 4, and 5) and form 13f. the commission proposed rule 10b-1 to, among other things, provide market participants (including counterparties, issuers, and issuers' stakeholders) and regulators with access to information that may indicate that a person (or a group of persons) is building up a large sbs position, and to alert market participants and regulators to the existence of concentrated exposures to a limited number of counterparties, which should inform those market participants and regulators of the attendant risks, allow counterparties to risk manage and lead to better pricing of the sbs with respect to transactions with persons holding large positions in those sbs (as a result of all market participants having access to the information about the positions).\\637\\ item 6 of schedule 13d, on the other hand, is intended to implement section 13(d)(1)(e), where congress specifically mandated that the disclosure statement filed would include information as to any contracts, arrangements, or understandings with any person with respect to any securities of the issuer, including the names of relevant parties, as part of its intent to require disclosures to security holders regarding persons with significant holdings. 1711, at 8 (1968) (``the purpose of section 13(d) is to require disclosure of information by persons who have acquired a substantial interest, or increased their interest in the equity securities of a company by a substantial amount, within a relatively short period of time.'' while the majority of edgar filings under the commission's rules are submitted in html or ascii, certain edgar filings are submitted using machine-readable, xml-based languages that are each specific to the particular edgar document type being submitted.\\640\\ this includes filings that, like schedules 13d and 13g, are submitted by individuals and entities other than the registrant of the class of securities.\\641\\ for these edgar xml filings, filers are typically provided the option to either submit the filing directly to edgar in xml, or manually input their disclosures in a fillable web form as part of an online web application developed by the commission that converts the completed form into an edgar-specific xml document.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: see supra note 829. a higher positive abnormal stock return may imply higher costs if there is less such activism under an accelerated filing timeline but also higher benefits to investors from accelerating disclosure due to the greater importance of the information to the market. \\935\\ see section iv.b.3.a.ii above for definitions of these terms and section iv.c.1 above for discussions in which we conclude that both the benefits and costs of the shortened initial schedule 13d filing deadline are likely to be limited for corporate action filings. for example, as discussed above, these benefits and costs are likely to vary across ``corporate action'' as compared to ``non- corporate-action'' filings,\\935\\ across issuers of different sizes,\\936\\ and by the identity of the filer.\\937\\ ideally, a tiered approach would be used to accelerate disclosure specifically in circumstances where the benefits of accelerated disclosure are greater and the costs of accelerated disclosure are lower. further, the subgroups of filings that are associated with the greatest costs under an accelerated filing deadline (and where there thus could be significant advantages of maintaining the 10-day deadline) are also the same subgroups associated with the greatest benefits under an accelerated deadline, while those associated with lower costs are associated with lower benefits.\\938\\ this pattern mitigates our ability to improve the costs of the amendments by implementing a tiered approach. \\932\\ see letter from icm.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: for example, commenters stated that affected funds, as pass- through investment vehicles, have a less complex business than traditional operating companies, and thus require less market scrutiny.\\106\\ commenters also stated that market scrutiny is less relevant for affected funds because, unlike operating companies, affected funds must satisfy the investor protection requirements of the investment company act and related commission rules, including requirements relating to financial transparency, valuation of portfolio securities, transactions with affiliates, and board oversight, among others.\\107\\ \\106\\ see, e.g., ici comment letter; see also aba comment letter (stating that, unlike operating companies, affected funds ``generally describe their operations in terms of a stated investment objective and investment strategies that tend to remain constant over time'').

            "🔹 Summary: we also do not believe it would be appropriate, as commenters suggested, to modify the proposed amendments to permit an affected fund whose adviser or sub-adviser was determined to have aided or abetted or caused a violation by the fund of the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws to preserve its wksi eligibility by terminating the adviser or sub-adviser.\\127\\ an operating company currently will be an ineligible issuer under the anti-fraud prong even if the operating company terminates all of the employees who aided or abetted the underlying violation of the federal securities laws, and our amendments will provide comparable treatment if an affected fund were to terminate its adviser. specifically, we are adopting a parallel anti-fraud prong for affected funds, which provides that an affected fund is an ineligible issuer if within the past three years its investment adviser, including any sub-adviser, was the subject of any judicial or administrative decree or order arising out of a governmental action that determines the investment adviser aided or abetted or caused the affected fund to have violated the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws.\\123\\ we believe this amendment is appropriate because investment companies typically are externally managed by an investment adviser, which is primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the fund and the preparation of the fund's disclosures.\\124\\ \\123\\ see amended paragraph (1)(ix) of the ineligible issuer definition in rule 405. commenters suggested that we clarify that a violation of section 206(4) of the advisers act, or the rules adopted under section 206(4) (except for 17 cfr 275.206(4)-8 (rule 206(4)-8)), by an affected fund's investment adviser or sub- adviser would not give rise to wksi ineligibility for the affected fund.\\125\\ these commenters also recommended that we modify the proposed anti-fraud provision so that an affected fund would not be an ineligible issuer if the investment adviser (or sub-adviser) that was the subject of a judicial or administrative decree or order as described in the proposed rule no longer advises the affected fund at the time the affected fund seeks wksi status.\\126\\ \\125\\ see acc comment letter; cbd comment letter. we received several comments requesting that we clarify or modify certain aspects of the proposed amendments. \\122\\ see amended paragraph (1)(i) of the ineligible issuer definition in rule 405. second, we are adopting, as proposed, an amendment to the definition of ineligible issuer to give effect to the definition's anti-fraud prong in the context of affected funds.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: \\136\\ we also are making a technical amendment to rule 486(b)(1)(iv) to provide a more accurate cross reference to item 9.1.c of form n-2. we proposed a change to item 34.6 of form n-2, under which funds currently undertake to provide an sai upon request, to require an affected fund to also undertake to provide a prospectus upon request. this is similar to the benefits the final rule will provide to affected funds that file short- form registration statements or qualify as wksis, as those funds also will be able to make certain updates to their registration statements more efficiently (i.e., through forward incorporation by reference or automatically effective registration statements and post-effective amendments).\\137\\ we believe it is appropriate for any affected fund that conducts delayed or continuous offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(ix), (x), or (xi) to have a mechanism for bringing its financial statements up to date under section 10(a)(3) without delay.\\138\\ together, the amendments we are adopting in this release and current rule 486 will achieve this objective. as discussed in the proposing release, our staff has previously stated that it would not recommend that the commission take enforcement action under certain provisions of the securities act if, on a case-by- case basis, specific listed registered cefs that conduct offerings under rule 415(a)(1)(x) use rule 486(b) to file certain post-effective amendments that are immediately effective upon filing.\\130\\ the proposing release noted that staff in the division of investment management were reviewing these no-action letters to determine if they should be withdrawn in connection with any final rules. rule 172 allows issuers, brokers, and dealers to satisfy final prospectus delivery obligations if a final prospectus is or will be on file with the commission within the time required by the rules and other conditions are satisfied.\\150\\ for example, rule 172 provides that a final prospectus will be deemed to precede or accompany a security for sale for purposes of section 5(b)(2) as long as the final prospectus is filed with the commission or it will be filed as part of the registration statement.\\151\\ rule 172 applies only to final prospectuses and not to other documents.\\152\\ rule 173 requires the delivery of a copy of the final prospectus or, in lieu of a final prospectus, a notice to purchasers stating that a sale of securities was made pursuant to a registration statement or in a transaction in which a final prospectus would have been required to have been delivered in the absence of rule 172.\\153\\ \\150\\ 17 cfr 230.172 (securities act rule 172); see also securities offering reform adopting release, supra footnote 5, at nn.560-562 and accompanying text.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: h. new registration fee payment method for interval funds and issuers of certain exchange-traded products we are adopting a modernized approach to registration fee payment that will require interval funds to pay securities registration fees using the same method that mutual funds and etfs use today.\\198\\ specifically, for interval funds, the final rule will provide that such funds register an indefinite amount of securities upon their registration statements' effectiveness.\\199\\ like mutual funds and etfs, interval funds will be required to pay registration fees based on their net issuance of shares, no later than 90 days after the funds' fiscal year ends.\\200\\ these issuers will be required to file information about the computation of this registration fee and other information on form 24f-2 under the investment company act when paying the fee.\\201\\ in response to comments that we received, we also are extending similar treatment to certain etps that are not registered under the investment company act. the final amendments to rule 103(a) will enhance parity between affected funds and operating companies, consistent with the bdc act and the registered cef act, as rule 103(a) already provides that an operating company's failure to make a public disclosure required solely by rule 100 of regulation fd will not affect its eligibility to use form s-3.\\197\\ \\196\\ rule 100 of regulation fd generally requires an issuer to make either simultaneous or prompt public disclosure of any material nonpublic information regarding the issuer or its securities that the issuer or a person acting on its behalf has selectively disclosed to certain parties. 3. rule 103 of regulation fd we are adopting amendments to rule 103(a) of regulation fd, as proposed, to provide that an affected fund's failure to make a public disclosure required solely by rule 100 of regulation fd will not affect the fund's eligibility under the short-form registration instruction of form n-2.\\196\\ we did not receive comments on the proposed amendments to rule 103(a). \\212\\ rule 424(i) also includes certain disclosure requirements modeled after form 24f-2. \\193\\ section 803(b)(2)(n) of the bdc act (directing us to amend item 13(b)(1) of schedule 14a to include as an issuer to which item 13(b)(1) applies a bdc that would otherwise meet the requirements of note e of the schedule); section 509(a) of the registered cef act (requiring us to provide certain registered cefs with the same flexibility under the proxy rules, subject to appropriate conditions, as is available to other issuers required to file reports under section 13 or section 15(d) of the exchange act).\n",
            "🔹 Summary: many of these amendments are not required by the bdc act or the registered cef act, but we believe are consistent with the respective acts' requirements to increase regulatory parity of affected funds with otherwise similarly-situated issuers.\\213\\ as discussed in detail below, these amendments include structured data requirements; new annual reporting requirements; amendments to provide all affected funds additional flexibility to incorporate information by reference; and enhancements to the disclosures that registered cefs make to investors when the funds are not updating their registration statements. it also could help investors in affected funds by providing them investor protections that are currently provided to investors in similarly-situated issuers. we are adopting amendments to our rules and forms, substantially as proposed, intended to tailor the disclosure and regulatory framework for affected funds in light of our amendments to the offering rules. \\213\\ for example, regulatory parity could mitigate any competitive disparities between affected funds and other issuers. see, e.g., infra discussion in paragraphs accompanying footnotes 284-289.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: however, an affected fund making a shelf offering under rule 415(a)(1)(x) is required to file a new registration statement every three years, which provides investors with a periodic update of consolidated information.\\406\\ the final rule will require that affected funds provide in their annual reports certain information currently disclosed in their prospectuses to make the information more readily available in one document for investors.\\407\\ further, securities act forms s-3 and f-3 have long permitted incorporation by reference from the issuer's exchange act reports, and investors have not indicated they are unduly burdened when investing in offerings registered on these forms.\\408\\ studies have shown, however, that the majority of investors in operating companies are institutional investors, whereas the majority of investors in the securities of affected funds are retail investors, who may face relatively higher costs associated with searching for information distributed across multiple documents.\\409\\ in addition, the requirement to backward and forward incorporate by reference certain information into a short-form registration statement could increase an affected fund's liability with respect to information that has not previously been incorporated into its registration statement because this information will now be part of the registration statement. the final rule will allow an affected fund to not deliver final prospectuses directly to investors if the fund files the final prospectus with the commission and certain other conditions are satisfied. and 17 cfr 240.10b-10 (rule 10b-5 under the exchange act)), which may ameliorate the potential costs associated with reduced staff review.\\405\\ \\405\\ certain of our discretionary amendments may also ameliorate these costs. see infra section iii.e.3 (discussing the benefits and costs of the requirement to disclose material unresolved staff comments) and section iii.e.2 (discussing the benefits and costs of the structured data requirements). while an investor could request a copy of the final prospectus under rule 173, there will be burdens on an investor to make such a request (e.g., loss of time while making the request and a delay in receiving the prospectus).\n",
            "🔹 Summary: however, excluding unlisted registered cefs from the final rule could create unnecessary competitive disparities between unlisted registered cefs and unlisted bdcs and would not provide investors in unlisted registered cefs with the benefits of the new investor protections we are adopting. under this approach, unlisted registered cefs would not have been able to take advantage of certain benefits of the amendments that would otherwise be available to unlisted bdcs, such as the cost savings associated with the final prospectus delivery reforms.\\414\\ this alternative also could have saved unlisted registered cefs certain compliance costs stemming from the proposed rulemaking, such as the requirement to tag certain prospectus information using inline xbrl. \\413\\ see supra paragraph accompanying footnotes 50-51. under the bdc act and the registered cef act, we could have extended the final rule only to bdcs, listed registered cefs, and interval funds. moreover, we are not at this time adopting the proposed new reporting requirements on form 8-k that would have imposed costs on unlisted affected funds.\\417\\ \\415\\ see aba comment letter. with respect to the proposed discretionary amendments, one commenter stated that the proposal would impose regulatory and compliance costs on unlisted affected funds, while at the same time providing unlisted interval funds with only small benefits and providing no benefits to other unlisted affected funds (e.g., tender offer funds).\\415\\ we believe interval funds and other continuously- offered unlisted affected funds will directly benefit from two of our discretionary amendments.\\416\\ while the final rule also imposes certain costs on these funds, we believe those costs are warranted, as discussed in detail below.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: we believe the final rule will provide similar benefits to certain etps that are not registered under the investment company act by allowing these etps to elect to register an indeterminate number of securities and to pay registration fees in arrears on an annual net basis. moreover, the amendments will allow etps that are not registered under the investment company act to use a similar registration fee payment method as etfs that are registered under the investment company act. the amendments will also avoid the possibility that such an etp will inadvertently sell more shares than it has registered and will not require the issuer to periodically register new shares. the cover page tagging requirement includes new check boxes that will help identify whether a registration statement is, for example, an automatic shelf registration statement or a short-form registration statement.\\426\\ we already require registrants to tag all of the information on the cover page of form 10-k, form 10-q, form 8-k, form 20-f, and form 40-f using inline xbrl.\\427\\ the requirement to tag the form n-2 cover page in inline xbrl is expected to benefit investors by enabling investors and information intermediaries to automate their use of the cover page information, including company name, the act or acts to which the registration statement relates, and check boxes relating to the effectiveness of the registration statement. under the final rule, affected funds will be required to tag the following form n-2 prospectus disclosure items using inline xbrl: fee table; senior securities table; investment objectives and policies; risk factors; share price data; and capital stock, long-term debt, and other securities.\\422\\ these items provide important information about an affected fund's key features, costs, and risks and may be particularly useful to investors to inform their investment decisions.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: under the amendments to rule 8b-16, registered cefs relying on paragraph (b) of the rule must describe in their annual reports the fund's current investment objectives and policies, and principal risks, and certain key changes that occurred during the relevant year in enough detail to allow investors to understand each change and how it may affect the fund. we estimate that approximately 521 registered cefs relied on rule 8b-16 as of december 31, 2019 and will therefore provide the new disclosure.\\446\\ these registered cefs also will be required to preface disclosure of these key changes with a legend clarifying that the disclosures provide only a summary of certain changes that have occurred in the past year, and that the summary may not reflect all of the changes that have occurred. because these funds are already required to disclose in their annual reports the enumerated changes to specified form n-2 disclosure items--and therefore already must have and maintain, among other things, updated information about the investment objectives, policies and principal risks that we are requiring them to disclose in full--the new requirement will likely add only a small incremental compliance burden. we believe the requirement for registered cefs to include mdfp disclosure in their annual shareholder reports will be beneficial to investors by helping them assess a fund's performance over the prior year and complementing other information in the report, which may make the annual report disclosure more understandable as a whole. this requirement will also promote parity between different types of funds, as open-end funds and bdcs are already required to provide similar disclosure in their annual reports.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: for example, if an investor requested a copy of the affected fund's prospectus in accordance with rule 173, the fund would in some cases need to deliver a much longer document if we did not amend form n-2's backward incorporation by reference provisions.\\450\\ we do not, however, expect that the backward incorporation by reference amendment will substantially reduce the amount of information affected funds deliver to investors by mail or electronically. we are also modifying form n-14 to decrease the disclosure burden of the form and reduce the length of form n-14 prospectuses in certain circumstances.\\457\\ the amendments will allow bdcs to incorporate by reference to the same extent as registered cefs. however, because affected funds that choose to rely on rules 172 and 173 will be deemed to have delivered their disclosures upon filing with the commission instead of giving them to investors, the current backward incorporation delivery requirement will not result in delivery of incorporated materials to a fund's investors, thus making less accessible the disclosure materials that might affect their investment decision. alternatively, we could have retained form n-2's current backward incorporation by reference requirements and continued to require funds to deliver incorporated materials to new investors. we estimate that the printing and mailing costs associated with the new requirements will be approximately $750 per fund in recognition that the requirement to deliver information that has been incorporated by reference may result in greater overall costs since affected funds that are eligible to file short-form registration statements under the final rule will be able to use incorporation by reference more frequently.\\456\\ we anticipate, however, that investors may be less likely to request copies of materials that have been incorporated by reference into an affected fund's prospectus or sai, so we believe this requirement will only incrementally increase costs.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: such an alternative would have made it less efficient for certain continuously-offered unlisted affected funds to update their financial statements or make other changes to their registration statements relative to the processes available to all other funds that conduct continuous or delayed offerings under the commission's rules. \\459\\ see supra section ii.d. as an alternative, we could have continued to limit rule 486 to interval funds. \\460\\ see aba comment letter.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: the ppa also amended section 6103 to make section 6104(c), in its entirety, subject to its confidentiality and disclosure provisions. section 6103(p)(4) requires an aso, as a condition for receiving returns or return information under section 6104(c), to establish and maintain certain safeguards, such as keeping permanent standardized records of all requests and disclosures, maintaining a secure information storage area, restricting access to the information, and providing whatever other safeguards the irs deems necessary to protect the confidentiality of the information. the ppa also amended sections 7213, 7213a, and 7431 to impose civil and criminal penalties for the unauthorized disclosure or inspection of section 6104(c) information. section 6103(a)(2) provides the general rule that returns and return information are confidential and that an officer or employee of a state who receives returns or return information from the irs under section 6104(c) must not disclose such information, except as authorized by title 26 of the united states code. 301.6103(p)(4)-1 and irs publication 1075, ``tax information security guidelines for federal, state and local agencies''.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: thus, these final regulations adopt the safeguard requirements as proposed. this agreement, which serves as the written request required by section 6103(d), has been the foundation of the state tax disclosure program under this provision since the tax reform act of 1976. after the enactment of the ppa, the irs revised its disclosure procedures under section 6104(c), as set forth in the internal revenue manual, to model them after the section 6103(d) program. after considering the comments in the letter, the nprm is adopted by this treasury decision with one clarifying substantive change to sec. in view of the current participation in the section 6104(c) disclosure program, and considering the potential for increased participation by other asos, the treasury department and the irs consider the publication of these final regulations important in fulfilling the mandate under section 6104(c) to facilitate the enforcement of state law regarding exempt organizations consistent with statutory requirements. as noted in the background, the section 6104(c) agreement, under which the irs discloses certain information to the aso who is charged with the administration of the state's laws regulating charitable organizations or the solicitation or administration of charitable funds or assets, is based on the section 6103(d) agreement, under which the irs discloses certain information to the state office charged with the responsibility for administering the state's tax laws.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: under section 6104(c) before its amendment by the ppa, the irs was required to disclose to asos certain final determinations, with no requirement that the aso request such disclosure in writing. the ppa changed this procedure, making all of section 6104(c) subject to the confidentiality provisions of section 6103. these final regulations provide that the irs may not disclose information under section 6104(c) unless the state receiving the information follows the applicable disclosure, recordkeeping, and safeguard procedures of section 6103(p)(4). 301.6104(c)-1(b), which provides that the irs may require an aso to execute a disclosure agreement or similar document, states that it is not clear what, if any information--other than that available to the general public--would be disclosed to asos without an agreement. to give effect to the confidentiality restrictions mandated by congress, the irs's disclosure program requires an aso to enter into a disclosure agreement with the irs stipulating the procedures for disclosure under section 6104(c), as well as the restrictions on use and redisclosure. the commenter, citing proposed sec.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: the legislative history of section 6104(c) provides that the term ``officer or employee'' does not include agents and contractors, and the final regulations apply this agent-contractor disclosure prohibition equally to the irs and the aso. 301.6104(c)-1(g)(2) to make such use of disclosed information under rules similar to those in section 6103(h)(4), as provided in section 6104(c)(4). the requirement in proposed sec. 301-6104(c)-1(g)(1) provides that an aso who receives information from the irs under section 6104(c) may redisclose that information for certain purposes to another state officer or employee. consequently, these final regulations clarify the proper application of the prohibition against disclosure to agents and contractors by eliminating proposed sec.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: among the disclosure, recordkeeping, and safeguard provisions of section 6103, section 6103(p)(4) requires an aso, as a condition for receiving returns or return information under section 6104(c), to establish and maintain certain safeguards, such as keeping permanent standardized records of all requests and disclosures, maintaining a secure information storage area, restricting access to the information, and providing whatever other safeguards the irs deems necessary to protect the confidentiality of the information. the commenter notes that many states have document retention and freedom-of-information laws that might be implicated whenever an aso receives or acts upon tax return information acquired from the irs. according to the commenter, nothing in the ppa or regulations addresses what portions of tax return information may become a part of the aso's own records or work product. this issue, however, is addressed by section 6103, made applicable to section 6104(c) by the ppa. upon completion of the aso's use of the returns or return information it receives under section 6104(c), section 6103(p)(4)(f) requires the aso to return the information, along with any copies, to the irs, or to render it undisclosable and report to the irs how it was so rendered.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the irs will not disclose or make available for inspection under section 6104(c) any information, the disclosure of which it determines would seriously impair federal tax administration, including, but not limited to-- (1) identification of a confidential informant or interference with a civil or criminal tax investigation; and (2) information obtained pursuant to a tax convention, as defined in section 6105(c)(2), between the united states and a foreign government. no such disclosure may be made if the irs determines that the disclosure would seriously impair federal tax administration. the irs may require an aso to execute a disclosure agreement or similar document specifying the procedures, terms, and conditions for the disclosure or inspection of information under section 6104(c), including compliance with the safeguards prescribed by section 6103(p)(4), as well as specifying the information to be disclosed. special analyses this regulation is not subject to review under section 6(b) of executive order 12866 pursuant to the memorandum of agreement (april 11, 2018) between the department of the treasury and the office of management and budget regarding review of tax regulations.

            "🔹 Summary: section 163(j)(8) defines ati as the taxable income of the taxpayer without regard to the following: items not properly allocable to a trade or business; business interest and business interest income; net operating loss (nol) deductions; and deductions for qualified business income under section 199a. generally, these terms include interest expense and interest includible in gross income that is properly allocable to a trade or business (as defined in section 163(j)(7)) and do not include investment income or investment expense within the meaning of section 163(d). concurrently with the publication of the final regulations, the treasury department and the irs are publishing in the proposed rule section of this edition of the federal register (rin 1545-bo76) a notice of proposed rulemaking providing additional proposed regulations under section 163(j) (reg-107911-18) (concurrent nprm). the treasury department and the irs continue to study comments on certain issues related to section 163(j), including issues that are beyond the scope of the final regulations (or the concurrent nprm in the proposed rules section of this issue of the federal register), and may discuss those comments if future guidance on those issues is published. disqualified interest included interest paid or accrued to (1) related parties when no federal income tax was imposed with respect to such interest; (2) unrelated parties in certain instances in which a related party guaranteed the debt; or (3) certain real estate investment trusts (reit).\n",
            "🔹 Summary: for purposes of this exception, the term ``federal regulator'' means the securities and exchange commission (sec), the commodity futures trading commission (cftc), or a prudential regulator, as defined in section 1a(39) of the commodity exchange act (7 u.s.c. most commenters recommended that any anti-avoidance rule in the final regulations contain a requirement that the taxpayer have a principal purpose to avoid section 163(j). the treasury department and the irs do not adopt commenters' suggestions to delay finalizing the embedded loan rule or to provide guidance on determining if a nonperiodic payment is ``significant'' because the same embedded loan rule applied in the context of section 446 for over 20 years from 1993 to 2015. see t.d. the final regulations do not adopt this recommendation because it is beyond the scope of the final regulations and because there are significant differences between the rules governing income inclusions in respect of passive foreign investment companies (pfics), such as foreign mmfs, and rics. these differences make it difficult to adopt a rule that would provide for look-through treatment in the context of dividends or inclusions from a pfic.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the definition of ``disallowed business interest expense'' has been revised in the final regulations to reflect that, solely for purposes of section 163(j) and the section 163(j) regulations, disallowed business interest expense is treated as ``paid or accrued'' in the taxable year in which the expense is taken into account for federal income tax purposes (without regard to section 163(j)), or in a succeeding taxable year in which the expense can be deducted by the taxpayer under section 163(j), as the context may require. commenters asked for clarification as to whether disallowed business interest expense should be treated as ``paid or accrued'' in the taxable year in which such expense is taken into account for federal income tax purposes (without regard to section 163(j)), or whether such expense instead should be treated as paid or accrued in the succeeding taxable year in which the expense can be deducted by the taxpayer under section 163(j). in certain contexts, a disallowed business interest expense must be treated as paid or accrued in the year the expense was paid or accrued without regard to section 163(j) to give effect to congressional intent. this outcome also is inconsistent with congressional intent. however, in other contexts, a disallowed business interest expense must be treated as paid or accrued in a succeeding taxable year to allow for the deduction of the carryforward in that year.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: i. applicability dates the proposed regulations provide generally that the final regulations would apply to taxable years ending after the date that this treasury decision is published in the federal register. whether an entity has multiple trades or businesses is a factual determination, and numerous court decisions that define the meaning of ``trade or business'' also provide taxpayers guidance in determining whether more than one trade or business exists. accordingly, the final regulations generally apply to taxable years beginning on or after the date that is 60 days after the date that this treasury decision is published in the federal register. the proposed applicability date has been changed in the final regulations to avoid the application of the changes reflected in the final regulations to a taxpayer at the end of the taxable year, which may result in unexpected effects on the taxpayer under section 163(j). accordingly, the final regulations define ``trade or business'' as a trade or business within the meaning of section 162, which should aid taxpayers in the proper allocation of interest expense, interest income, and other tax items to a trade or business and to an excepted or non-excepted trade or business.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the section 52(a) and (b) aggregation rules were enacted as part of the work opportunity tax credit, but have also been applied to numerous code provisions, including sections 45a, 45s, 264, 280c and 448. the affiliated service group rules under section 414(m) were enacted to address certain abuses related to qualified retirement plans, but also have been applied to several other code provisions, including sections 45r, 162(m), 414(t), 4980h, and 4980i. one commenter recommended that a taxpayer should include gross receipts only from entities eligible for the small business exemption (exempt entities). 8179 was published in the federal register to clarify that the cross-reference in sec. to provide a consistent definition of the term ``syndicate'' for purposes of sections 163(j), 448, and 1256, the treasury department and the irs propose to define the term ``syndicate'' using the actual allocation rule from the definition in sec. 1.163(j)-2(d)(2)(i) provide that, for a taxpayer that is not a corporation or a partnership, the gross receipts test of section 448(c) applies as if the taxpayer were a corporation or a partnership.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: c. section 108 in the preamble to the proposed regulations, the treasury department and the irs requested comments on the interaction between section 163(j) and the rules addressing income from the discharge of indebtedness under section 108. in response, commenters noted, for example, that it is unclear whether cancellation of indebtedness income under section 61(a)(11) arises when the taxpayer only receives a benefit in the form of a disallowed business interest expense carryforward, or whether any exclusions, such as sections 108(e)(2) or 111, or any tax benefit principles, should apply. the final regulations also include examples to demonstrate the calculation of ati if a loss tentatively is suspended in the calculation of tentative taxable income, and if a loss is carried forward from a prior taxable year under section 469. 1.163(j)-3(b)(9) generally provides that provisions requiring interest expense to be treated as something other than business interest expense, such as section 163(d) governing investment interest expense, govern the treatment of the interest expense. the ordering and operating rules provide that section 163(j) applies before the operation of the loss limitation rules in section 465 and 469, and before the application of section 461(l), and after other provisions of the code that defer, capitalize, or disallow interest expense. the treasury department and the irs agree with this comment, and an appropriate revision has been made in the final regulations to account for any possible additional provisions that could require interest to be capitalized.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: in particular, disallowed business interest expense may affect the calculation of foreign tax credits and the amount of qualified business asset investment within the meaning of section 951a(d)(1) (qbai) taken into account in determining a u.s. shareholder's tax liability under section 951a. in order to provide similar treatment to similarly situated taxpayers, the final regulations also provide that, for purposes of calculating ati, the tentative taxable income of cooperatives not subject to taxation under subchapter t of the code is not reduced by the amount of deductions equivalent to the amounts deducted by cooperatives under sections 1382(b)(1), (b)(2), and (c). however, if the partnership also has investment interest income, any portion thereof that is allocable to a c corporation partner is treated as business interest income of the partner, and any other investment income of the partnership that is allocable to the c corporation partner increases the partner's ati. the treasury department and the irs also have determined that excess business interest expense should not be eligible for reattribution under sec. 1.163(j)- 4(b)(3)(i) to cover not only a partnership's items of investment interest, investment income, and investment expense, but also a partnership's other separately stated tax items that are subject to neither section 163(j) nor section 163(d).\n",
            "🔹 Summary: thus, the final regulations adopt a cumulative register approach rather than this alternative approach. therefore, the final regulations adopt a cumulative section 163(j) srly register. the treasury department and the irs expect to issue future guidance regarding the interaction of section 163(j) and sec. thus, the final regulations do not adopt the commenter's recommendation. moreover, the commenter expressed concern that a consolidated group could choose where to incur business interest income within a group and thereby affect which member has disallowed business interest expense carryforwards.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: with regard to each of these instances, the s corporation may elect to ``close the books'' even though the corporation will file one federal income tax return for the taxable year covering both separate taxable periods. subchapter s also specifies instances in which an s corporation may elect, or is required, to file a federal income tax return for a short taxable year (actual short taxable year). see section 1362(e)(3) (providing an election to have items assigned to each short taxable year under normal federal income tax accounting rules). the commenter's approach provides a method for allocating excess business interest expense, but it does not provide any guidance on allocating excess taxable income or excess business interest income. however, in order to clarify that trusts and decedents' estates taxable under section 641 compute ati without regard to deductions under sections 651 and 661, the final regulations explicitly provide for this positive ati adjustment.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: accordingly, the final regulations clarify that section 163(j) applies to foreign corporations whose income is relevant for u.s. tax purposes, other than by reason of section 881 or 882 (relevant foreign corporations). as a general matter, application of u.s. tax principles to a foreign corporation for purposes of determining its income for u.s. tax purposes is within the authority of the treasury department and the irs. in addition to clarifying that these rules apply to all relevant foreign corporations, the final regulations otherwise adopt these rules unchanged. the proposed regulations provide additional guidance for an applicable cfc (and other foreign persons) with eci in proposed sec. 1.952-2, a foreign corporation is treated as a domestic corporation for u.s. tax purposes when calculating its taxable income, including by application of section 163(j).\n",
            "🔹 Summary: accordingly, the final regulations reserve on the application of the business interest expense deduction limitation to foreign persons with eci. 1.163(j)-8 provides rules for applying section 163(j) to a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation with eci. in the concurrent nprm, the treasury department and the irs are proposing rules for determining the amount of deductible business interest expense and disallowed business interest expense carryforward of a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or partnership that is properly allocable to eci. 1.163(j)-8, the treasury department and the irs continue to study methods of determining the amount of deductible business interest expense and disallowed business interest expense carryforwards that are allocable to eci. 1.882- 5 should be treated as attributable to a partnership and subject to the section 163(j) limitation at the partnership level.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: thus, in order to address the commenters' concerns, and to provide immediate transition guidance under section 163(j) for taxpayers affected by the various amendments to the code made by the cares act (including, for example, the technical corrections to section 168(e) of the code relating to the classification of qualified improvement property), revenue procedure 2020-22 was issued to provide an automatic extension of time to make, or an opportunity to withdraw, an election for taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, or 2020. the revenue procedure also provides the time and manner of making or revoking the three elections provided by the cares act under section 163(j)(10) for taxable years beginning in 2019 or 2020. c. the anti-abuse rule under proposed sec. 1.163(j)-1(b)(13) include a new provision noting that the secretary may issue guidance on whether a trade or business can be an electing real property trade or business or electing farming business. b. one-time late election or withdrawal of election procedures commenters requested a one-time automatic extension of time for certain taxpayers to file an election under section 163(j)(7)(b) or section 163(j)(7)(c) due to uncertainty about the effect of a decision to make or not make such an election and about which taxpayers are eligible to make such an election prior to the publication of the final regulations. the preamble to the proposed regulations provides that a taxpayer that qualifies for the small business exemption is not eligible to make an election for a trade or business to be an electing real property trade or business or an electing farming business, in part because the taxpayer is already not subject to the section 163(j) limitation, and in part because an electing real property trade or business or an electing farming business is required to use ads for certain types of property under section 163(j)(10) and cannot claim the additional first-year depreciation deduction under section 168(k) for those types of property. the treasury department and the irs were concerned that certain small business taxpayers might make the election without realizing that the election could have adverse effects on their deduction for depreciation expense and their method of accounting for depreciation.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: commenters also recommended that no allocation between business and nonbusiness interest expense be required when a partnership is wholly owned by corporate partners because a corporation can have only business interest income and expense and cannot have investment interest income and expense (see proposed sec. the commenter also recommended that the treasury department and the irs reconsider whether, in certain circumstances, items from intercompany transactions (other than business interest expense and business interest income) should affect the amount of the consolidated group's ati. 1.163(j)-10 with other federal income tax rules. the matching rule can apply to ensure that the taxable items of the two members harmonize with regard to timing and character in order to reach the same overall tax treatment that would be given to a single corporation whose two operating divisions engaged in those transactions. however, the treasury department and the irs continue to study these comments and may provide future guidance on this issue.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: 1.163(j)-10(d) even if the loan document doesn't require the creditor to look exclusively to an asset as security for payment of principal and interest on a loan (as required by sec. because corporations cannot have investment income under section 163(d)(4)(b), this additional requirement does not otherwise affect their ability to look- through the stock of a non-consolidated c corporation. the preamble to the proposed regulations also provides that a taxpayer that is eligible for the small business exemption may not make an election under proposed sec. however, the treasury department and the irs have determined that, if a taxpayer applies the look-through rule to a cfc, the taxpayer may allocate its basis in its cfc stock to an excepted trade or business to the extent the cfc is engaged in either (i) an excepted trade or business, or (ii) a foreign-regulated utility trade or business that would be treated as an excepted trade or business if the utility meets certain requirements related to regulation by a foreign government. v. coordination of section 752 basis reduction rule and investment asset basis reduction rule multiple commenters noted that the combined effect of the section 752 basis reduction rule and the investment asset basis reduction rule could require a partner, other than a c corporation or a tax-exempt corporation, in a partnership that holds investment assets funded by partnership liabilities to reduce the adjusted tax basis of its partnership interest twice--once for the partnership's basis in its investment assets, and a second time for the liabilities that funded their purchase.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: section 163(j)(2) permits business interest expense for which a deduction is disallowed under section 163(j)(1) to be carried forward to the succeeding taxable year. some commenters also claimed that the inclusion of current-year disallowed business interest expense in the definition of a ``loss corporation'' is inconsistent with the statutory language of section 382(k)(1). the treasury department and the irs have determined that section 382 should apply to current-year disallowed business interest expense (to the extent such expense is allocable to the pre-change period) because this approach is consistent with the statutory treatment of nols. moreover, as a policy matter, current-year attributes that relate to the period before an ownership change should be subject to section 382. the exclusion of these items would permit trafficking in losses, which is contrary to the stated policy underlying section 382 of preventing ``exploit[ation] by persons other than those who incurred the loss.'' commenters noted that, viewed in isolation, section 382(k)(1) would not appear to apply to a corporation that has only a current-year disallowed business interest expense.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: such an election does not terminate the loss corporation's taxable year as of the change date (in other words, the change year is still treated as a single tax year for federal income tax purposes). the treasury department and the irs acknowledge that a ratable allocation approach may lead to distortions and administrative burdens in certain situations. 1.382-6(b), the amount of the corporation's deduction for current-year business interest expense is calculated based on ratable allocation for purposes of calculating the corporation's taxable income attributable to the pre- change period. section 1.382- 6(b)(4) also provides correlative rules for the allocation of disallowed business interest expense carryforwards to the pre-change and post-change periods when a closing-of-the-books election is made. thus, the final regulations permit a loss corporation to allocate current-year business interest expense between the pre-change and post-change periods using the closing-of-the-books method set forth in sec.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: section 1.383-1(d) provides ordering rules for the utilization of pre-change losses and pre-change credits and for the absorption of the section 382 limitation and the section 383 credit limitation. the treasury department and the irs have decided not to adopt this recommended approach, for several reasons. as described in the preamble to the proposed regulations, the treasury department and the irs prioritized the use of disallowed business interest expense carryforwards over nols because ``taxpayers must calculate their current-year income or loss in order to determine whether and to what extent they can use an nol in that year, and deductions for business interest expense, including carryforwards from prior taxable years, factor into the calculation of current-year income or loss.'' 1.383-1(d) in the final regulations. second, as stated in the preamble to the proposed regulations, deductions for business interest expense (including disallowed business interest expense carryforwards) factor into the determination whether and to what extent a taxpayer can use an nol in a taxable year.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: in other words, because the old loss corporation gets the benefit of treating certain creditors as shareholders for purposes of determining whether the corporation has undergone an ownership change within the meaning of section 382(g), the corporation must treat the debt held by such creditors as equity for federal income tax purposes. b. application of section 382(e)(3) a commenter also recommended that the final regulations address the application of section 382(e)(3) to foreign corporations with section 382 disallowed business interest carryforwards. a. application of section 382(l)(5) section 382(l)(5) provides an exception to the general loss limitation rule under section 382(a) for an old loss corporation in title 11 proceedings or in similar cases if the historic shareholders and creditors of such corporation own at least 50 percent of the stock of the new loss corporation as a result of being shareholders or creditors immediately before the ownership change. however, because of the complexity of this area, the treasury department and the irs included the clarification to prevent possible confusion and to provide certainty to taxpayers that there is no double detriment with respect to section 382 disallowed business interest carryforwards. as a result, if a foreign corporation with no u.s. trade or business undergoes a section 382 ownership change, section 382(e)(3) appears to limit the corporation's section 382 disallowed business interest carryforwards to $0.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the other nine terms in section 469(c)(7)(c) currently remain undefined, although the treasury department and the irs intend to issue additional guidance in the future to provide definitions for these terms. one commenter also requested that the definition of a real property trade or business be revised to include broadband, street lighting, telephone poles, parking meters, and rolling stock. the treasury department and the irs expect that such examples generally will provide very limited guidance to most taxpayers because any such examples likely will be viewed as inapplicable for taxpayers with any differing facts and circumstances. commenters also requested clarification that a trade or business should not be required to have a direct nexus or relationship to rental real estate in order to qualify as a real property trade or business under section 469(c)(7)(c). 1.469- 9(b)(2) (for purposes of section 469(c)(7)(c)) necessarily would encompass or include the definition of a trade or business as provided in sec.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the final regulations provide guidance on how to allocate partnership excess business interest expense, excess business interest income, and excess taxable income to partners. as described in the background section earlier, the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (cares act) amended section 163(j) to provide special rules relating to the ati limitation for taxable years beginning in 2019 or 2020. the section 163(j) limitation applies to all taxpayers, except for certain small businesses with average annual gross receipts of $25 million or less (adjusted for inflation) and certain trades or businesses. b. definition of interest the statute limits the amount of deductible interest expense for a taxpayer but, as described in the explanation of provisions section of the proposed regulations, there are no generally applicable statutory provisions or regulations addressing when financial instruments are treated as debt for federal income tax purposes or when a payment is counted as interest. for example, the final regulations may specify a tax treatment that few or no taxpayers would adopt in the absence of specific guidance but that nonetheless advances congressional intent. in the tcja, congress also repealed the use of gross income in the apportionment of interest expense under section 864 of the code (see section 14502(a) of the tcja).\n",
            "🔹 Summary: taxpayers make the elections by timely filing a federal income tax return or form 1065, including extensions, an amended federal income tax return, amended form 1065, or administrative adjustment request, as applicable. the final regulations clarify that a taxpayer that is unsure whether its activity constitutes a trade or business under section 162 is eligible to make an election. status business (new model).. 1545-0123. published in the federal register on 10/8/18. 1.163(j)-2(b)(ii), while any taxpayer subject to the section 163(j) limitation is eligible to make the election, the treasury department and the irs estimate that only taxpayers that actively want to reduce their deductions will make this election. under the final regulations, those taxpayers are eligible to make a protective election.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: if a taxpayer chooses to make the election for its trades or businesses, the taxpayer must attach to its tax return a statement identifying and describing the trade or business for which the election is being made, and must provide other information as the commissioner may require in forms, instructions, or other published guidance. this certification can be made because the treasury department and the irs have determined that the regulations may affect a substantial number of small entities but have also concluded that the economic effect on small entities as a result of these regulations is not expected to be significant. chapter 6), it is hereby certified that the final regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of section 601(6) of the regulatory flexibility act (small entities). pursuant to section 7805(f) of the code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding this regulation was submitted to the chief counsel for advocacy of the small business administration for comment on its effect on small business, and no comments were received. however, under the final regulations, small taxpayers operating regulated utility trades or businesses, real property trades or businesses and farming trades or businesses are now eligible to protectively elect out of the election.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: section 202 of the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 (umra) requires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits and take certain actions before issuing a final rule that includes any federal mandate that may result in expenditures in any one year by a state, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private section, of $100 million in 1995 dollars, update annually for inflation. this rule does not include any federal mandate that may result in expenditures by state, local, or tribal governments, or by the private section in excess of that threshold. v. executive order 13132: federalism executive order 13132 (entitled ``federalism'') prohibits an agency from publishing any rule that has federalism implications if the rule either imposes substantial, direct compliance costs on state and local governments, and is not required by statute, or preempts state law, unless the agency meets the consultation and funding requirements of section 6 of the executive order. this final rule does not have federalism implications and does not impose substantial direct compliance costs on state and local governments or preempt state law within the meaning of the executive order.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: for purposes of this paragraph (b)(22)(ii)(c), the term federal regulator means the securities and exchange commission (sec), the commodity futures trading commission (cftc), or a prudential regulator, as defined in section 1a(39) of the commodity exchange act (7 u.s.c. for purposes of this paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(b), the term federal regulator means the securities and exchange commission (sec), the commodity futures trading commission (cftc), or a prudential regulator, as defined in section 1a(39) of the commodity exchange act (7 u.s.c.

            "🔹 Summary: as proposed, the final rule will amend the annual review component of advisers act rule 206(4)-7 (``compliance rule'') to require all sec-registered advisers to document their annual review in writing, and we are adopting this rule as proposed.\\61\\ we are adopting this requirement for two key reasons. the dodd-frank act also provided the commission with the ability to require the limited number of advisers to private funds that did not have to register to file reports about their business activities. among other things, congress amended the advisers act generally to require advisers to private funds to register with the commission and to authorize the commission to establish reporting and recordkeeping requirements for advisers to private funds for investor protection and systemic risk purposes.\\6\\ specifically, title iv of the dodd-frank act repealed an exemption from registration contained in section 203(b)(3) of the advisers act--known as the ``private adviser exemption''--on which many private fund advisers, including those to private equity funds, hedge funds, and venture capital funds,\\7\\ had relied.\\8\\ in addition to eliminating this provision, congress directed the commission to adopt more limited exemptions for advisers that solely advise private funds, if the adviser has assets under management in the united states of less than $150 million, or that solely advise venture capital funds.\\9\\ section 203(b)(3) of the act, as amended by the dodd-frank act, also provides an exemption from registration for certain foreign private advisers. the final rule will require sec- registered advisers conducting an adviser-led secondary transaction to satisfy certain requirements; however, in a change from the proposal, advisers may obtain a fairness opinion or a valuation opinion under the final rule.\\56\\ sec-registered advisers conducting an adviser-led secondary transaction must also prepare and distribute a written summary of any material business relationships between the adviser or its related persons and the independent opinion provider. as proposed, the final rule will amend the advisers act recordkeeping rule to require advisers who are registered or required to be registered to retain books and records related to the quarterly statement rule, the audit rule, the adviser-led secondaries rule, and the preferential treatment rule.\\62\\ in a change from the proposal, we are also amending the advisers act recordkeeping rule to require advisers who are registered or required to be registered to retain books and records related to the restricted activities rule.\\63\\ we are adopting these requirements to enhance advisers' internal compliance efforts and to facilitate the commission's enforcement and examination capabilities by improving our staff's ability to assess an adviser's compliance with the final rule.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: another commenter similarly argued that, because congress added section 211(e) to the advisers act requiring the promulgation of rules to establish the form and content of certain reports regarding private funds required to be filed with the commission under subsection 204(b) of the advisers act, it ``is inconceivable that congress intended section 211(h) to grant the broad private fund disclosure authority it claims when congress spoke with such precision [in adding section 211(e)] within the same section of the advisers act.'' \\119\\ see, e.g., sifma-amg comment letter i; comment letter of federal regulation of securities committee of the business law section of the american bar association (apr. for example, section 204(b) of the act, entitled ``records and reports of private funds,'' specifically authorizes the commission to require registered investment advisers to maintain such records of, and file with the commission such reports regarding, private funds advised by the investment adviser, as necessary and appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors, or for the assessment of systemic risk by the financial stability oversight council and to provide or make available to the council those reports or records or the information contained therein. see also prohibition of fraud by advisers to certain pooled investment vehicles, investment advisers act release no. 1760, 86th cong., 2d sess., at 8 (1960) (``this [section 206(4) language] is almost the identical wording of section 15(c)(2) of the securities exchange act of 1934 in regard to brokers and dealers.'').\n",
            "🔹 Summary: below we provide examples of these distinguishing features and how they relate to certain aspects of the final rules. see also comment letter of nasaa on prohibition of fraud by advisers to certain pooled investment vehicles; accredited investors in certain private investment vehicles (dec. 27, 2006) (``nasaa supports the application of the proposed rule to advisers registered or required to register at the state level.''). \\201\\ see rule 206(4)-1. a communication to a current investor can be an ``advertisement,'' for example, when it offers new or additional investment advisory services with regard to securities. however, the final rule does not include an exception for such advisers. unlike other private funds that are primarily purchased, with respect to u.s. persons, through a primary issuance pursuant to regulation d, which generally restricts a security's transferability and does not contemplate an investor's resale of the security to a third party, saf interests are primarily purchased in the united states through a primary issuance and subsequently resold and traded on the secondary market by qualified institutional buyers pursuant to regulation 144a.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: we recognize, however, that even traditional, closed-end private equity funds have certain redemption or withdrawal rights for regulatory events (e.g., redemptions related to the employee retirement income security act (``erisa'') and the bank holding company act (``bhca'')) and other extraordinary circumstances (e.g., redemptions related to a violation of a state pay-to-play law). see use of electronic media by broker dealers, transfer agents, and investment advisers for delivery of information; additional examples under the securities act of 1933, securities exchange act of 1934, and investment company act of 1940, release no. \\318\\ this includes the antifraud provisions of section 206 of the advisers act, rule 206(4)-8 under the advisers act (rule 206(4)- 8), section 17(a) of the securities act, and section 10(b) of the exchange act (and rule 10b-5 thereunder), to the extent relevant. if we were to establish a realization test based on a different trigger (e.g., the sale of a portfolio investment) it might not be applicable for certain kinds of private funds (e.g., private credit funds that primarily make loans). (c) prominent disclosure of performance calculation information as proposed, the final rule will require advisers to include prominent disclosure of the criteria used and assumptions made in calculating the performance.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: \\440\\ see final rule 211(h)(1)-2(f). an example might include how unequal tax expenses are factored into consolidated performance reporting where one fund has greater tax expenses than the other funds in a consolidated fund structure. advisers generally should also disclose any important assumptions associated with consolidated reporting that affect performance reporting as part of the quarterly statement. some commenters suggested that we should provide additional specific clarification on when consolidated reporting is and is not required.\\444\\ while we recognize that a principles-based approach to consolidated reporting may require some additional consideration on the part of advisers, an overly prescriptive consolidation requirement would have a greater negative effect. see supra section ii.b.2.c).\n",

            "🔹 Summary: \\585\\ as a fiduciary, the adviser is obligated to act in the fund's best interest and to make full and fair disclosure to the fund of all conflicts and material facts associated with the adviser-led transaction. section 202(a)(16) of the act [15 u.s.c. the final rule requires an adviser to obtain the opinion from an independent opinion provider, which is defined as a person that provides fairness opinions or valuation opinions in the ordinary course of its business and is not a related person of the adviser.\\596\\ the requirement that the opinion provider not be a related person of the adviser reduces the risk that certain affiliations could result in a biased opinion and would further mitigate the potential influence of the adviser's conflicts of interest. \\595\\ see, e.g., houlihan comment letter (stating that the final rule should not require the fairness opinion to state that the private fund and/or its investors may rely on the fairness opinion); aima/acc comment letter; cravath comment letter. we are receptive to commenters' concerns, however, that requiring a fairness opinion could result in increased costs to investors and that there may be other mechanisms to provide investors with unconflicted, objective data about the value of assets that are the subject to an adviser-led secondary transaction.\\586\\ we understand that, in some cases, the cost of a valuation opinion would be lower than a fairness opinion, but that a valuation opinion would still provide investors with a strong basis to make an informed decision.\\587\\ namely, a valuation opinion would also provide a third-party check on valuation which is critical to addressing the conflicts of interest inherent in adviser-led secondary transactions.\\588\\ under the final rule, advisers and investors will have the ability to negotiate whether a fairness opinion or valuation opinion is more appropriate.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: in contrast, the final rule would mandate disclosure that covers a discrete time period and that must be provided to investors at a time when investors can use the information to make investment decisions. some commenters stated that this requirement is unnecessary because advisers are already required to disclose material conflicts of interest to private fund investors.\\599\\ we recognize that an adviser has an obligation to comply with rule 206(4)-8 under the advisers act and avoid omitting material facts, but that rule does not impose an affirmative obligation on advisers to provide specific disclosure on their conflicts of interest. capture any new material business relationships that may have developed only shortly before the issuance of such opinion. this required disclosure would also deter advisers from seeking opinions from highly conflicted opinion providers as it may raise objections from investors. for example, an opinion provider that receives an income stream from an adviser for performing services unrelated to the issuance of the opinion might not want to jeopardize its business relationship with the adviser by alerting the private fund investors that the price being offered is unfair (or by otherwise refusing to issue the opinion).\n",

            "🔹 Summary: in light of this change from the proposal to allow an adviser to satisfy disclosure and, in some cases, consent requirements, as applicable, instead of being prohibited from certain activities, we are amending rule 204-2 under the advisers act to require sec-registered investment advisers to retain books and records to document their compliance with the disclosure and consent aspects, as applicable of the restricted activities rule. a communication to a current investor is an ``advertisement'' when it offers new or additional investment advisory services with regard to securities. because many entities that receive performance-based compensation are fiscally transparent for u.s. federal income tax purposes and thus not subject to entity-level taxes, determining the actual taxes paid on ``excess'' performance- based compensation can be challenging, particularly for larger advisers that have not only a significant number of participants that receive such compensation but also have participants subject to non-u.s. tax regimes. \\628\\ see final rule 211(h)(1)-1. see supra section ii.b.3 (``preparation and distribution of quarterly statements'') for a discussion of the ``distribution'' requirement generally. \\661\\ see nvca comment letter (stating that the commission should consider the alternative of using enhanced disclosures instead of banning clawback reduction provisions); comment letter of opseu pension plan trust (aug. 18, 2022) (stating that investment terms are a negotiation between advisers and institutional investors and that the final rules should generally focus on disclosure rather than prohibitions); sifma-amg comment letter i (stating that, if adopted, the final rule should require advisers to include estimated clawback calculations reflecting any adjustments for taxes as part of the quarterly statement reporting requirements, which would enable investors to assess a potential clawback situation and any potential reductions for taxes, that may arise); aic comment letter i (stating that, if adopted, the final rule should require only quarterly disclosures to private fund investors of the potential clawback payable and the amount of carried interest distributions that have been reserved against the potential clawback).\n",
            "🔹 Summary: to satisfy its fiduciary duty, an adviser must eliminate or at least expose through full and fair disclosure all conflicts of interest which might incline an investment adviser to provide advice that is not disinterested.\\740\\ full and fair disclosure should be sufficiently specific so that a client is able to understand the material fact or conflict of interest and make an informed decision whether to provide consent.\\741\\ the disclosure must be clear and detailed enough for the client to make an informed decision to consent to the conflict of interest or reject it.\\742\\ when making disclosures to private fund investors, advisers should also be mindful of their antifraud responsibilities per rule 206(4)-8 under the advisers act. some commenters opposed the prohibition,\\722\\ while others supported it.\\723\\ one commenter encouraged the commission to expand the scope of the proposed prohibition by preventing an adviser from borrowing from co-investment vehicles or other accounts.\\724\\ another commenter that opposed the proposed prohibition stated that the prohibition was unnecessary because advisers and their related persons rarely borrow from fund clients.\\725\\ these commenters asserted that the proposed prohibition could inadvertently prohibit activity that could benefit investors, such as tax advances,\\726\\ borrowing arrangements outside of the fund structure,\\727\\ and the activity of service providers that are affiliates of the adviser, especially with large financial institutions that play many roles in a private fund complex.\\728\\ commenters also stated that the rule could prohibit certain types of transactions that are permitted (e.g., an adviser purchasing securities from a client), with appropriate disclosure and consent, under section 206(3) of the advisers act.\\729\\ one commenter stated that we should instead require disclosure of adviser borrowings on form pf and form adv,\\730\\ while other commenters stated that we should provide exemptions for borrowings disclosed to investors or lpacs to ensure that these arrangements are entered into on arm's length terms.\\731\\ \\722\\ see sifma-amg comment letter i; nyc bar comment letter ii; iaa comment letter ii. further, section 206(4) of the advisers act permits the commission to prescribe a means to prevent acts, practices, and courses of business that are fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative. additionally, the related books and records requirement in final rule 204-2(a)(24) will require advisers to maintain this information in a manner that permits easy location, access, and retrieval of any particular record. finally, in response to commenters, we are clarifying that we did not intend for the proposed rule to prohibit certain practices that have the potential to benefit investors, and we would not interpret ordinary course tax advances and management fee offsets as borrowings that are subject to this final rule, as discussed below.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: depending on the facts and circumstances, we believe that this conduct may also violate other federal securities laws, rules, and regulations, such as rule 206(4)-8, which prohibits advisers to pooled investment vehicles from, among other things, defrauding investors or prospective investors. \\753\\ we proposed to adopt this rule under sections 206 and 211 of the advisers act. \\761\\ see aic comment letter i (stating that ``[i]f monitoring fees are charged based on the deal size, periodic payments instead of a lump sum payment can provide the portfolio company with liquidity management by spreading the costs over time, even though the services and resulting value creation may not correspond to the same time period of payments. proposing release, supra footnote 3, at 134. see also 2019 ia fiduciary duty interpretation, supra footnote 5, at 1 and n.2-3 (discussing an adviser's fiduciary duty under federal law). if the adviser reasonably expects to provide services to a portfolio investment, the adviser may attempt to provide full and fair disclosure to all investors or a group representing all investors, such as a fund board or an lpac.\\758\\ but, in some instances, disclosure may be insufficient.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: for example, the commission adopted regulation fd to address selective disclosure by certain issuers of material nonpublic information under the exchange act. selective disclosure to certain parties is a fundamental concern often prohibited or restricted under other federal securities laws. we also believe that state laws generally require disclosure of information that would not have a material, negative effect on other investors, such as fee and expense transparency.\\854\\ \\853\\ see ny state comptroller comment letter; calpers comment letter; predistribution initiative comment letter ii; ropes & gray comment letter; piff comment letter; nyc comptroller comment letter; aima/acc comment letter; ny state comptroller comment letter; iaa comment letter ii. in addition, an adviser can have a conflict of interest that may cause it to agree to provide preferential information rights to a certain investor in exchange for something of benefit to the adviser. the commission stated that selective disclosure occurs when issuers release material nonpublic information about a company to selected persons, such as securities analysts or institutional investors, before disclosing the information to the general public.\\843\\ this practice undermines the integrity of the securities markets--both public and private--and reduces investor confidence in the fairness of those markets.\\844\\ \\843\\ see id.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: commenters expressed concern that the rule would impede the co-investment process because the rule could be interpreted to prohibit selective disclosure of portfolio holding information to investors with co-investing rights and advisers would need to assess whether information provided to co- investors triggers the prohibition.\\866\\ one commenter suggested excluding co-investment vehicles from the definition.\\867\\ while we understand commenter concerns, we believe that we should adopt the definition as proposed because excluding co-investment vehicles that have substantially similar investment policies, objectives, or strategies would expose investors to similar risks that the rule is intended to address and potentially allow advisers to circumvent the rule. it would also include pooled vehicles with different base currencies and pooled vehicles with embedded leverage to the extent such pooled vehicles have substantially similar investment policies, objectives, or strategies as those of the subject private fund. \\866\\ see aic comment letter ii; segal marco comment letter (stating that the proposed rule would require advisers to offer every co-investment opportunity to every investor, which could prevent private funds from maximizing value for investors). we believe that this change is appropriate because, as discussed above, we believe that certain distinguishing structural and operational features of safs have prevented or deterred saf advisers from engaging in the type of conduct that the final rules seek to address, such as the granting of preferential treatment. many commenters argued that the proposed definition of ``substantially similar pool of assets'' was overbroad and suggested that we narrow the definition.\\860\\ these commenters suggested that we limit the definition to, for example, funds that invest side by side, pari passu, with the main fund in substantially all investment opportunities (which would, among other things, make it easier for advisers to determine their compliance obligations under the rule and prevent investors from being subject to limitations on liquidity and information rights) \\861\\ and that we exclude co-investment vehicles and separately managed accounts.\\862\\ in contrast, one commenter suggested broadening the proposed definition beyond pooled vehicles to include separately managed accounts because separately managed accounts can pose similar risks to pooled vehicles.\\863\\ this rule is designed to address the specific concerns that arise out of the lack of transparency and governance mechanisms prevalent in the private fund structure and protects underlying investors in those funds from being disadvantaged as a result of preferential treatment given to underlying investors in other similar pools because the adviser does not have a fiduciary duty to those underlying investors.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the disclosure will also help prevent investors from being potentially defrauded or deceived by preferential treatment that negatively impacts their investment in the private fund.\\871\\ \\871\\ as discussed above, investors can use this information to protect their interests, including through negotiations regarding new investments and renegotiations regarding existing investments, and to make more informed business decisions. one commenter supported the ability of an adviser to choose when to provide the annual disclosure as long as the adviser provides it on an annual basis.\\888\\ some commenters suggested that the final rule only require annual disclosure (instead of also requiring pre-investment disclosure).\\889\\ we believe that the annual notice requirement will require advisers to reassess periodically the preferential terms they provide to investors in the same fund, and investors will benefit from receiving periodic updates on preferential terms provided to other investors in the same fund (e.g., investors will benefit because they will be able to assess whether such preferential treatment presents new conflicts for the adviser). even if co-investment rights do not include different fee and expense terms, and for example, are offered to provide an investor with additional exposure to a particular investment or investment type, investors often negotiate for those rights and give up other terms in the bargaining process in order to secure access to co-investment opportunities. this change also addresses a commenter's suggestion that any final rule account for the different negotiating processes for open-end and closed-end funds.\\886\\ \\885\\ the disclosure requirements are not limited to an investor's initial investment in the fund. this is designed to prevent investors from being misled because it will provide them with transparency regarding how the terms may affect their investment, how the terms may affect the adviser's relationship with the private fund and its investors, and whether the terms create any additional conflicts of interest.\\881\\ to address commenter concerns about timing and impeding the closing process, the final rule will limit advance disclosure to those terms that a prospective investor would find most important and that would significantly impact its bargaining position (i.e., material economic terms, including, but not limited to, the cost of investing, liquidity rights, fee breaks, and co-investment rights \\882\\).\n",
            "🔹 Summary: one commenter suggested that we require advisers to provide the preferential treatment disclosures only upon request to reduce the burden on advisers and require investors to consider what information is important to them.\\896\\ we believe that requiring advisers to provide and distribute the disclosures under this rule is essential to placing investors in the best position to negotiate the terms of their investment (with regard to the advance disclosure) and, with regard to the post-investment and annual disclosures, in the best position to consider and negotiate future investment opportunities, including with the adviser providing the disclosures. \\897\\ see aima/acc comment letter (suggesting that the final rule allow advisers to make the written notices available via a data room, where appropriate). see use of electronic media release, supra footnote 435; see also supra section ii.b.3 (discussing the distribution requirements). \\892\\ final rule 211(h)(2)-3(b)(2). \\893\\ as a practical matter, a private fund that does not admit new investors or provide new terms to existing investors does not need to deliver an annual notice.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: regarding preferential treatment, the final rules further align fund adviser actions and investor interests by prohibiting certain preferential treatment practices altogether (instead of only requiring disclosure or consent), specifically prohibiting preferential terms regarding liquidity or transparency that have a material, negative impact on investors in the fund or a similar pool of assets.\\1706\\ prohibiting these activities, and prohibiting remaining preferential treatment activities unless certain disclosures are provided, may eliminate some of the complexity and uncertainty that investors face about the outcomes of their investment choices, further reducing costs investors must undertake to find appropriate matches between their choice of private fund and their preferences over private fund terms, investment strategies, and investment outcomes. the above pro-efficiency effects may also be strengthened by the reduced risks of non-compliance and increased efficiency of the commission's enforcement and examination of non-compliance resulting from the final amendments to the compliance rule for a written documentation requirement and the amendments to the books and records rule.\\1708\\ \\1708\\ see supra sections vi.d.7, vi.d.8. many commenters emphasized the risks to potential losses of efficiency and questioned the possible benefits to efficiency.\\1713\\ some commenters emphasized particular provisions of the rule as bearing substantial risks to efficiency, such as the proposed prohibition on pass-through of certain fees and expenses.\\1714\\ other commenters raised broad concerns that the entire regime would reduce efficiency by restricting the ability of market participants to freely negotiate contractual terms among themselves.\\1715\\ other commenters stated broadly that the proposing release economic analysis had failed to consider important ways in which the proposed rules may affect efficiency.\\1716\\ we believe many of commenters' concerns are mitigated by the revisions to the final rules as compared to the proposed rules, such as the provision of certain exceptions for many of the proposed activities where certain disclosures are made and, in some cases, where the required investor consent is also obtained. lastly, the rules prohibit certain activities that represent possible conflicting arrangements between investors and fund advisers, with certain exceptions where certain disclosures regarding those activities are made and, in some cases, where the required investor consent is also obtained. there may also be a risk of the transparency benefits of the rule getting reduced by advisers restructuring their funds to be safs to meet the exclusion under the final rules.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: as stated above, some commenters stated that the proposed private fund adviser rules and other recently proposed or adopted rules would have interacting effects, and that the effects should not be analyzed independently.\\1739\\ these commenters stated in particular that the combined costs of multiple ongoing rulemakings would harm investors by making it cost-prohibitive for many advisers to stay in business or for new advisers to start a business, and that this effect would further harm competition by creating new barriers to entry.\\1740\\ as stated above, commission acknowledges that the effects of any final rule may be impacted by recently adopted rules that precede it.\\1741\\ with respect to competitive effects, the commission acknowledges that there are incremental effects of new compliance costs on advisers that may vary depending on the total amount of compliance costs already facing advisers and acknowledges costs from overlapping transition periods for recently adopted rules and the final private fund adviser rules.\\1742\\ in particular, the commission acknowledges these sources of heightened costs from the recent adoption of amendments to form pf. we have also provided certain legacy status, namely regarding contractual agreements that govern a private fund and that were entered into prior to the compliance date if the rule would require the parties to amend such an agreement, for all advisers under the prohibitions aspect of the preferential treatment rule and all aspects of the restricted activities rule requiring investor consent.\\1728\\ we have lastly included several exceptions from the final rules on preferential treatment, such as an exception from the prohibition on providing certain preferential redemption terms when those terms are offered to all investors.\\1729\\ at the margin, however, some advisers, particularly smaller or emerging advisers, may find it more difficult to compete without offering preferential redemption rights or preferential information that will now be prohibited. the legacy status discussed above,\\1744\\ namely regarding contractual agreements that govern a private fund and that were entered into prior to the compliance date if the rule would require the parties to amend such an agreement, for all advisers under the prohibitions aspect of the preferential treatment rule and all aspects of the restricted activities rule requiring investor consent,\\1745\\ is also responsive to commenter concerns on compliance costs. the above pro-competitive effects may also be strengthened by the reduced risks of non-compliance and increased efficiency of the commission's enforcement and examination of non-compliance resulting from the final amendments to the compliance rule for a written documentation requirement and the amendments to the books and records rule.\\1721\\ \\1721\\ see supra sections vi.d.7, vi.d.8. in particular, since the effective date for the new form pf current reporting is december 11, 2023, the 18-month compliance period means smaller advisers will have over a year after the effective date of form pf current reporting to come into compliance with the final private fund adviser rules.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: as discussed above, specifically, the commission has stated that investors in many instances equate the practice of selective disclosure with insider trading, and that the inevitable effect of selective disclosure is that individual investors lose confidence in the integrity of the markets because they perceive that certain market participants have an unfair advantage.\\1761\\ more generally, as discussed above, one academic study found that the passing of regulation requiring advisers to hedge funds to register with the sec reduced hedge fund misreporting of results to investors, hedge fund misreporting increased on the overturn of that legislation, and that the passing of the dodd-frank act (which removed an exemption from registration on which advisers to hedge funds and other private funds had relied), resulted in higher inflows of capital to hedge funds, indicating that hedge fund investors view regulatory oversight as protecting their interests and that regulatory oversight increases investor confidence and willingness to invest in hedge funds.\\1762\\ \\1760\\ see supra sections vi.d.2, vi.d.3, vi.d.4, vi.d.5. the final rules may also enhance capital formation through their competitive effects by inducing new fund advisers to enter private fund markets.\\1759\\ to the extent that existing fund advisers reduce their fees to compete more effectively with new entrants, or to the extent that existing pools of capital are redirected to new fund advisers, or fund advisers who have reduced fees to compete, and the advisers receiving redirected capital generate enhanced returns for their investors (for example, advisers who generate larger returns, less correlated returns across different investment strategies, or returns with more favorable risk profiles), the competitive effects of the final rules may provide new opportunities for capital allocation and potentially spur new investments. we also disagree with the commenter that a qualified investor alternative would be a reasonable alternative to consider, as not applying the rule to advisers with respect to funds that can only be accessed by certain investors would have substantial negative consequences such as incentivizing advisers to restrict access to their funds. however, because the rule will strengthen the difference in compliance requirements for rias and eras, the final rule may strengthen this incentive for advisers to keep assets under $150 million, which may negatively affect capital formation. lastly, certain elements of the rules provide for certain relief to funds of funds.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: many of the investor protection benefits discussed above are specifically associated with the general applicability of the audit rule.\\1766\\ one commenter stated that the time and expense of an audit should be commensurate with the scale of the fund, removing the rationale for exempting smaller advisers.\\1767\\ we also believe that new rules with exemptions for certain types of funds and advisers, in general, distort incentives faced by advisers when determining their desired business model. \\1765\\ aic comment letter i, appendix 2. these exemptions could also have been applied in tandem, for example by exempting only advisers to hedge funds and other liquid funds below a certain asset threshold. we believe, however, that this narrower alternative with the above exemptions to the final audit rule would likely not provide the same investor protection benefits. as a final matter, the rule already is only applicable to rias and does not apply to eras, including those eras with less than $150 million in assets under management in the u.s.\\1769\\ \\1768\\ see supra section ii.c.7. as an immediate matter, limiting the requirement in this way would undermine the broader goal of the rule to protect investors against misappropriation of fund assets and providing an important check on the adviser's valuation of private fund assets.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: further, the commission clarified that the acts to ``coerce, manipulate, mislead or fraudulently influence'' that would be prohibited by rule 15fh-4(c) imply compelling the cco to act in a certain way through pressure, threats, trickery, intimidation, misrepresentation, or some other form of purposeful action not limited to untrue statements or omissions of material facts. further, to the degree that rule 9j-1 provides additional precision and specificity regarding the application of existing antifraud and anti-manipulation laws to misconduct in the security-based swap market, some market participants may need to spend fewer resources determining appropriate compliance under section 9(j) of the exchange act and reduce their compliance costs.\\334\\ \\334\\ see supra section v.d.1. the commenter states that such confusion and uncertainty could have a chilling effect on dialog about compliance, budget, and resource matters, which, by implication, could impede decision making within the sbs entity.\\336\\ in response to this comment, the commission has clarified the scope of final rule 15fh-4(c) in section iii.b. hence, provisions designed to exclude certain legitimate credit market conduct could unintentionally apply to activities that final rule 9j-1(a)(6), as revised from proposed rule 9j-1(b), is designed to prohibit, reducing the benefits of the rule. two commenters believed that re-proposed rule 9j-1 would require market participants to incur costs to design and implement extensive compliance programs and reconcile the scope of the new rule with existing practices.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: \\352\\ lsta letter at 7. the commission acknowledges the commenter's concern that not adopting the more prescriptive alternative approach could prevent lenders or security-based swap participants from exercising legitimate rights and remedies and impose costs that would be greater than those discussed in the 2021 proposing release in connection with re-proposed rule 9j-1.\\353\\ final rule 9j-1 would enable lenders or security-based swap participants to exercise legitimate rights and remedies, thereby addressing the commenter's concern. in addition, final rule 9j-1(e) provides for affirmative defenses similar to the affirmative defenses in rule 10b5- 1(c). in particular, paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of final rule 9j-1 describe conduct for which a non-scienter based standard would apply, while paragraph (a)(5) of final rule 9j-1 describes attempted aspects of that conduct for which scienter is the proper standard. the clarification regarding the liability standards of rule 9j-1 coupled with the affirmative defenses of rule 9j-1(e) should mitigate any potential adverse effects on market participation, liquidity, capital formation, and investor choice. moreover, by reducing the risk of fraudulent and manipulative activity in the security-based swap market, rule 9j-1 would increase market participation, liquidity, capital formation, and investor choice thereby further mitigating the potential adverse effects that commenters identified.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: as such the commission does not see the need to adopt separate rules for cds and equity security-based swaps. rule 9j-1 is appropriately tailored to address fraud and manipulation for the entire security-based swap market. conduct has the potential to harm counterparties to all forms of security-based swaps, including cds, equity security-based swaps, and non-cds debt security-based swaps. \\354\\ fletcher letter at 4.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: consistent with the proposed rules, these final regulations also provide that a real estate investment trust (reit), as defined in section 856(a), that owns a qualified real estate investment trust subsidiary as defined in section 856(i)(2) (qrs), is a publicly held corporation if the qrs issues securities required to be registered under section 12(b) of the exchange act, or is required to file reports under section 15(d) of the exchange act. these final regulations adopt the rule in the proposed regulations providing that, for ease of administration, a corporation is a publicly held corporation if, as of the last day of its taxable year, its securities are required to be registered under section 12 of the exchange act or it is required to file reports under section 15(d) of the exchange act. these final regulations also adopt the rules set forth in the proposed regulations providing that an affiliated group includes a parent corporation that is privately held if one or more of its subsidiary corporations is a publicly held corporation, and that an affiliated group may include more than one publicly held corporation as defined in section 162(m)(2). these final regulations do not adopt this suggestion because each corporation in an affiliated group is a separate taxpayer and section 162(m)(3) provides that each taxpayer that is a publicly held corporation has its own set of covered employees. a. in general as amended by tcja, section 162(m)(2) defines the term ``publicly held corporation'' as any corporation that is an issuer (as defined in section 3 of the securities exchange act of 1934 (exchange act)) of securities that are required to be registered under section 12 of the exchange act, or that is required to file reports under section 15(d) of the exchange act.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: pursuant to the amended definition of publicly held corporation in section 162(m)(2), the proposed regulations provide that a foreign private issuer \\2\\ (fpi) is a publicly held corporation if it is required to register securities under section 12 of the exchange act or file reports under section 15(d) of the exchange act. rather, these final regulations adopt the rules set forth in the proposed regulations providing that a fpi is a publicly held corporation if it is required to register securities under section 12 of the exchange act or file reports under section 15(d) of the exchange act. in response to notice 2018-68, commenters suggested that the proposed regulations provide that section 162(m) does not apply to fpis because fpis are not required to disclose compensation of their officers on an individual basis under the exchange act, unless similar disclosure is required by their home country.\\4\\ the commenters asserted that determining compensation on an individual basis (in order to determine the three most highly compensated executive officers) would require the fpis to expend significant time and money in adopting the necessary internal procedures to make the determination consistent with exchange act requirements that are inapplicable to them. \\3\\ the legislative history to tcja provides that the amendment to the definition of publicly held corporation under section 162(m) ``extends the applicability of section 162(m) to include . the determination that an officer is a covered employee because the officer is one of the three highest compensated executive officers, even if the officer's compensation is not required to be disclosed under the sec rules, is based on the flush language to section 162(m)(3), the legislative history,\\5\\ and the sec executive compensation disclosure rules.\\6\\ these final regulations also adopt the rule in the proposed regulations providing that the amount of compensation used to identify the three most highly compensated executive officers is determined pursuant to the executive compensation disclosure rules under the exchange act, substituting the publicly held corporation's taxable year for references to the corporation's fiscal year for purposes of applying the disclosure rules under the exchange act.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: as explained in section iii.d of the preamble to the proposed regulations, the reference to an employee in section 162(m) provides no indication that the term ``employee'' is limited to a current employee, since a reference in the code to an ``employee'' has frequently been interpreted in regulations as a reference to both a current and a former employee.\\7\\ in addition, as previously noted, the legislative history to section 162(m) makes clear that congress intended the term ``covered employee'' to include a former employee.\\8\\ accordingly, these final regulations adopt the proposed regulations without change. see blue book at page 260. consistent with section 162(m)(3)(c), as amended by tcja, and the legislative history, the proposed regulations provide that a covered employee identified for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2016, will continue to be a covered employee for all subsequent taxable years, including years during which the individual is no longer employed by the corporation and years after the individual has died. the treasury department and the irs have concluded that the better analysis is that congress intended to apply both section 162(m) and section 4960 to current and former employees. section 162(m)(3)(c), as amended by tcja, provides that a covered employee includes ``a covered employee of the taxpayer (or any predecessor) for any preceding taxable year beginning after december 31, 2016.'' 1.105-11(c)(3)(iii), the nondiscrimination rules of section 105(h)(3) apply to former employees even though the code uses only the term ``employees.''\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the treasury department and the irs did not adopt this rule because the analogy to the affiliated group proffered by the commenters does not take into account that the tax treatment of a partner in a partnership differs from the tax treatment of a corporation that owns stock in another corporation. in response to a commenter's request for clarification on the application of the rule that a publicly held corporation must take into account its distributive share of a partnership's compensation payment to the publicly held corporation's covered employee, the treasury department and the irs confirm that these final regulations address only application of the section 162(m) compensation deduction limitation to the publicly held corporation's distributive share of the payment. like the proposed regulations, these final regulations provide that compensation means the aggregate amount allowable as a deduction under chapter 1 of the code for the taxable year (determined without regard to section 162(m)) for remuneration for services performed by a covered employee, whether or not the services were performed during the taxable year, and that compensation includes an amount that is includible in the income of, or paid to, a person other than the covered employee, including after the death of the covered employee b. compensation paid by a partnership to a covered employee section 162(m)(1) provides that ``[i]n the case of any publicly held corporation, no deduction shall be allowed under this chapter for applicable employee remuneration with respect to any covered employee.'' these final regulations adopt the provisions of the proposed regulations and provide that a publicly held corporation must take into account its distributive share of a partnership's deduction for compensation paid to the publicly held corporation's covered employee in determining the amount allowable to the corporation as a deduction for compensation under section 162(m). assuming the partnership is respected for u.s. federal income tax purposes, section 162(m) generally would not apply to compensation paid to a publicly held corporation's covered employee by a corporate subsidiary of a partnership for services performed as an employee of the subsidiary because, in this circumstance, the corporate subsidiary would not be a member of the publicly held corporation's affiliated group.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: section 162(m)(4)(i), by cross-referencing sections 3121(a)(5)(a)- (d), generally excludes from compensation contributions by an employer on an employee's behalf to certain types of qualified retirement plans and payments from those types of plans to the employee. the tcja amendment of section 162(m) eliminates the exclusion from the deduction limitation for compensation paid after the individual is no longer a covered employee. section 162(m)(4)(c) excludes from the definition of compensation: ``(i) any payment referred to in so much of section 3121(a)(5) as precedes subparagraph (e) thereof, and (ii) any benefit provided to or on behalf of an employee if at the time such benefit is provided it is reasonable to believe that the employee will be able to exclude such benefit from gross income under this chapter.'' given that the amendments to section 162(m) no longer limit the deduction disallowance to taxable years in which a covered employee is employed on the last day of the taxable year, and the lack of statutory language or legislative history specifically indicating an intent to restrict the deduction limitation to compensation earned by the individual in the capacity as an employee, the treasury department and the irs have determined that the more appropriate construction of the statutory language defining ``applicable employee remuneration'' is to include all compensation paid to a covered employee regardless of the capacity in which the covered employee performed services to earn that compensation. for example, if a peo ceased serving as peo or as an executive officer but continued as an employee of the publicly held corporation for later taxable years, the former peo could be compensated without taking into account the potential for a limitation on the deduction due to section 162(m).\n",
            "🔹 Summary: these final regulations adopt the rules set forth in the proposed regulations providing that, in the case of a privately held corporation that becomes a publicly held corporation, section 162(m) limits the deduction for any compensation that is otherwise deductible for the taxable year ending on or after the date that the corporation becomes a publicly held corporation, and that a corporation is considered to become publicly held on the date that its registration statement becomes effective under the securities act or the exchange act. b. compensation subject to negative discretion these final regulations adopt the rule set forth in the proposed regulations providing that a provision in a compensation agreement that purports to provide the employer with the discretion to reduce or eliminate a compensation payment (negative discretion) is taken into account only to the extent the corporation has the right to exercise the negative discretion under applicable law (for example, applicable state contract law). accordingly, these final regulations do not provide a separate standard for purposes of applying the grandfather rule to compensation agreements that include this type of negative discretion provision (or any other type of negative discretion provision). 1.162-27(f)(1) and (2) of the 1995 regulations for privately held corporations that become publicly held after december 20, 2019. those sections of the 1995 regulations were formulated based on the legislative history to the enactment of section 162(m) and were intended to permit a transition period to meet the shareholder approval requirement for qualified performance-based compensation so that the resulting compensation would not be subject to the deduction limitation under section 162(m). these final regulations also adopt the transition relief set forth in the proposed regulations providing that a privately held corporation that becomes a publicly held corporation on or before december 20, 2019, generally may rely on the transition rules provided in sec.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: accordingly, these final regulations provide that the corporation's right to recover compensation does not affect the determination of the amount of compensation the corporation has a written binding contract to pay under applicable law as of november 2, 2017, whether or not the corporation exercises its discretion to recover any compensation in the event the condition arises in the future. the proposed regulations also provide that, if the condition occurs, then only the amount the corporation is obligated to pay under applicable law remains grandfathered, taking into account the occurrence of the condition. after further consideration, the treasury department and the irs recognize that the corporation's right to recover compensation is a contractual right that is separate from the corporation's binding obligation under the contract (as of november 2, 2017) to pay the compensation. the proposed regulations provide that, if the corporation is obligated or has discretion to recover compensation paid in a taxable year only upon the future occurrence of a condition that is objectively outside of the corporation's control, then the corporation's right to recovery is disregarded for purposes of determining the grandfathered amount for the taxable year.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: these final regulations adopt this alternative grandfather rule that disregards earnings and losses in order to minimize the administrative burden of tracking the earnings, losses and new contributions (if made) on an account balance plan or the increase or decrease in a nonaccount balance benefit after november 2, 2017. with respect to an account balance plan, the treasury department and irs understand that this grandfather rule may result in contributions made after november 2, 2017, not being subject to the section 162(m) limitation if the contributions offset losses; however, the treasury department and irs concluded that under many common arrangements the continuous separate tracking of earnings, losses, and contributions on the november 2, 2017, account balance through the payment date would be burdensome to administer while having a limited, if any, impact on the available deduction. furthermore, whether additional contributions and earnings and losses credited to the account balance after the termination date, through the earliest possible date the account balance could have been distributed to the employee, are grandfathered depends on whether the terms of the plan require the corporation to make those contributions or credit those earnings and losses through the earliest possible date the account balance could be distributed if it were terminated as of the termination date. if the corporation is obligated to pay the employee the account balance that is credited with earnings and losses and has no right to terminate or materially amend the contract, then the grandfathered amount would be the account balance as of november 2, 2017, plus any additional contributions and earnings and losses that the corporation is obligated to credit under the plan, through the date of payment. the treasury department and the irs agree and these final regulations permit the grandfathered amount to be allocated to the last otherwise deductible payment or to each payment on a pro rata basis for taxable years ending before december 20, 2019. however, these final regulations provide that the ordering rule requiring the grandfathered amount to be allocated to the first otherwise deductible payment paid under the arrangement must be used for taxable years ending on or after december 20, 2019, regardless of the method used to allocate the grandfathered amount for taxable years ending prior to that date. e. ordering rule for payments consisting of grandfathered and non- grandfathered amounts deductible for taxable years ending prior to december 20, 2019 these final regulations adopt the ordering rule set forth in the proposed regulations for identifying the grandfathered amount when payment under a grandfathered arrangement is made in a series of payments.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the grandfather rule described in section 13601(e) of tcja and its legislative history, including the definition and the resulting impact of a material modification, is almost identical to the statutory language and legislative history to the grandfather rule provided when section 162(m) was enacted in 1993. the 1995 final regulations interpreting the original grandfather rule in the 1993 legislation provided that a deferral of payment of compensation will not be treated as a material modification if any additional amount paid were determined based on a reasonable rate of interest or one or more predetermined actual investments, and there is no indication in the grandfather rule in section 13601 of tcja or its legislative history of an intent to adopt a different grandfather rule.\\17\\ therefore, these final regulations do not adopt the commenter's suggestion. a commenter suggested that these final regulations provide that the deferral of a grandfathered amount after november 2, 2017, but prior to september 10, 2018 (the publication date of notice 2018-68), is not a material modification even if the earnings on the deferred amount are not based on either a reasonable rate of interest or a predetermined actual investment because taxpayers were not aware prior to the publication of the notice that this deferral would constitute a material modification. \\17\\ section 1.162-27(h)(iii)(b) provides that if the contract is modified to defer the payment of compensation, any compensation paid in excess of the amount that was originally payable to the employee under the contract will not be treated as a material modification if the additional amount is based on either a reasonable rate of interest or one or more predetermined actual investments (whether or not assets associated with the amount originally owed are actually invested therein) such that the amount payable by the employer at the later date will be based on the actual rate of return of the specific investment (including any decrease as well as any increase in the value of the investment). if a written binding contract in effect on november 2, 2017, is subsequently modified to defer the payment of compensation, any compensation paid or to be paid that is in excess of the amount that was originally payable to the employee under the contract will not be treated as resulting in a material modification if the additional amount is based on either a reasonable rate of interest or a predetermined actual investment (whether or not assets associated with the original amount are actually invested therein) such that the amount payable by the employer at the later date will be based on the rate of interest or the actual rate of return on the investment (including any decrease, as well as any increase, in the value of the investment). additionally, a modification of the contract after november 2, 2017, to offer an additional or substitute a predetermined actual investment as an investment alternative under the arrangement is not a material modification.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: \\18\\ a non-statutory stock option is an option other than an incentive stock option described in section 422 or a stock option granted under an employee stock purchase plan described in section 423. the treasury department and the irs recognize that, for bona fide business reasons, an employer may want to extend an exercise period of a stock option or a stock appreciation right (sar). for the same reasons, these final regulations incorporate the section 409a regulatory provisions and provide that, if compensation attributable to the exercise of a non-statutory stock option or a sar is grandfathered and the exercise period of the option or sar is extended, then all compensation attributable to the exercise of the option or the sar is grandfathered if the extension complies with sec. these concerns led to treating certain extensions of stock options or sars as not being material modifications in the regulations under section 409a. 1.409a-1(b)(5)(v)(c)(1).\\19\\ \\19\\ section 1.409a-1(b)(5)(v)(c)(1) describes the following requirements for an extension: (1) at the time of the extension, the exercise price is greater than the underlying stock's fair market value and (2) the exercise period is extended to a date no later than the earlier of the latest date upon which the stock right could have expired by its original terms or the 10th anniversary of the original date of grant. this often occurs when a stock option or sar grant agreement provides that the exercise period will terminate immediately or within a short period following the employee's separation from service, but the employer later decides to waive that termination or otherwise extend the exercise period for some period of time upon the employee's separation from service.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: section 409a addresses nqdc arrangements and sets forth certain requirements that must be met to avoid current income inclusion, a 20% additional income tax on the amount includible in income per section 409a(a)(1)(b)(i)(ii), and a second additional income tax based on the tax benefit received due to the deferral per section 409a(a)(1)(b)(i)(i). accordingly, these final regulations provide that, for a corporation the fiscal and taxable years of which do not end on the same date, the rule requiring the determination of the three most highly compensated executive officers to be made pursuant to the rules under the exchange act applies to taxable years ending on or after december 20, 2019. second, the provisions defining a predecessor corporation of a publicly held corporation apply to corporate transactions that occur on or after december 30, 2020. these final regulations also include a special applicability date for corporations that change from being a publicly held corporation to a privately held corporation, and, later, back to a publicly held corporation on or after december 30, 2020. if a corporate transaction occurs before december 30, 2020, then taxpayers may apply either the definition of predecessor of a publicly held corporation in sec. notice 2018-68 also provided that the treasury department and irs anticipated that the guidance in the notice would be incorporated into future regulations that, with respect to the issues addressed in the notice, would apply to any taxable year ending on or after september 10, 2018. because these final regulations adopt the definitions of the terms ``written binding contract'' and ``material modification'' that were included in notice 2018-68, the guidance on these definitions in these final regulations applies to taxable years ending on or after september 10, 2018. effect on other documents section 4.01(13) of revenue procedure 2020-3, 2020-1 i.r.b. notice 2018-68 also provided that the treasury department and the irs anticipate that the guidance in the notice will be incorporated into future regulations that, with respect to the issues addressed in the notice, will apply to any taxable year ending on or after september 10, 2018. these final regulations adopt the definition of covered employee in notice 2018-68 as anticipated, and accordingly the definition of covered employee in these final regulations applies to taxable years ending on or after september 10, 2018. the treasury department and the irs recognize, however, that the rules under sec. b. special applicability dates these final regulations include special applicability dates covering certain aspects of the following provisions of these final regulations: 1. definition of covered employee.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: proposed regulations that would update the regulations under section 417(e) and make certain clarifying changes were published in the federal register on november 25, 2016 (81 fr 85190). comments were received on the proposed regulations, and a public hearing was held on march 7, 2017. after consideration of the comments, the proposed regulations are adopted by this treasury decision with certain changes described in the section of this preamble entitled ``summary of comments and explanation of revisions.'' however, the last sentence of section 411(d)(6)(b) provides that the secretary may by regulations provide that section 411(d)(6)(b) does not apply to a plan amendment that eliminates an optional form of benefit (other than a plan amendment that has the effect of eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit or a retirement-type subsidy). see also berger v. xerox retirement income guaranty plan, 231 f.supp.2d 804, 814 (s.d. the department of the treasury (treasury department) and the irs issued final regulations under section 417 relating to the qjsa and qpsa requirements in 1988 (53 fr 31854, august 22, 1988), and amended those regulations in 1998 (63 fr 16898, april 3, 1998), to reflect changes to section 417(e)(3) enacted by the retirement protection act of 1994, subtitle f of title vii of the uruguay round agreements act, public law 103-465, 108 stat.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: these regulations update the existing regulations to reflect the statutory changes made by ppa '06, including the new interest rates and mortality tables set forth in section 417(e)(3) and the exception from the valuation rules for certain applicable defined benefit plans set forth in section 411(a)(13). these regulations clarify that, for purposes of section 417(e)(3), the interest rates that are published by the commissioner are to be used without further adjustment. in addition, these regulations eliminate obsolete provisions relating to the transition from pre-1995 law to the interest rates and mortality assumptions under section 417(e)(3) as modified by rpa '94.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: these regulations also adopt the rule under the proposed regulations under which, for purposes of determining the present value under section 417(e)(3) with respect to the portion of the accrued benefit derived from employee contributions (the employee-provided accrued benefit) that is computed in accordance with the rules of section 411(c)(2), the probability of death before the assumed commencement date may not be taken into account. moreover, such an ancillary death benefit can be eliminated by plan amendment without violating the anti-cutback rule of section 411(d)(6). commenters generally supported this rule in the proposed regulations, and it is included in the final regulations at sec. a single-sum distribution determined in this manner would be greater than the minimum single-sum distribution that would satisfy section 417(e)(3) (and therefore would not be eligible for the exception to the requirement under sec. 89-60 of these minimum present values does not reflect the specification in 1994 of a mortality assumption in section 417(e)(3)(b).\\6\\ several commenters noted that some plan sponsors, in the absence of updated guidance following the 1994 amendment to section 417(e), have applied a preretirement mortality discount to both the employer-provided and employee-provided portions of the accrued benefit.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: pursuant to the memorandum of agreement, review of treasury regulations under executive order 12866 (june 9, 2023), tax regulatory actions issued by the irs are not subject to the requirements of section 6 of executive order 12866, as amended. therefore, a regulatory impact assessment is not required.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: this certification is based on the fact that the regulations reflect the statutory changes to section 417(e) made by ppa '06 and also provide additional flexibility in plan design. for example, while the regulations clarify the application of the minimum present value requirements of section 417(e) to an sslio, most defined benefit plans sponsored by small employers do not include an sslio. pursuant to section 7805(f), the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the chief counsel for advocacy of the small business administration for comment on their impact on small business, and no comments were received. moreover, for those plans that do provide for sslios, the regulations provide flexibility in the application of the minimum present value requirements by permitting the implicit bifurcation of the sslio into a temporary annuity (required to be determined using the minimum present value factors under section 417(e)(3)) and a life annuity (to which the minimum present value requirements do not apply). although the regulations might affect a substantial number of individuals, the economic impact of the regulations on small businesses is not expected to be significant.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: rules 17ad-22(e)(2)(ii) and (iii) require covered clearing agencies to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for governance arrangements that clearly prioritize the safety and efficiency of the covered clearing agency and support the public interest requirements in exchange act section 17a.\\77\\ these existing requirements are sufficient to ensure a registered clearing agency has due regard for financial stability. accordingly, the commission is declining to expand the scope of this rule to develop participant categories and to require certain level of participant representation on the board as non-independent directors among those categories. \\77\\ see 17 cfr 240.17ad-22(e)(2)(ii), (iii); see also 17 cfr 240.17ad-22(d)(8) (requiring registered clearing agencies that are not covered clearing agencies to establish, implement, maintain and enforce governance arrangements that are clear and transparent to fulfill the public interest requirements in exchange act section 17a). one commenter agreed with the commission's concerns that a small number of participants--if allowed to exercise control over a clearing agency--can promote margin or other requirements that are not commensurate with the risks of a participant's specific products, portfolio market, business model, and size, which could lead to a concentration of risk in a few dominant market participants who benefit.\\78\\ the commenter suggested that the commission adopt rules that would address non-independent directors and would require diversity among participant representation on the board, based on size and level of specialization by said participants. however, the exchange act requirement for fair representation allows for the consideration of proportionality as an element.\\79\\ although all participants are equally exposed to default risk, larger firms may be more impacted by policies that apply based on transaction volume.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: such fitness standards for serving as a director would need to be consistent with all the requirements of proposed rule 17ad-25, and also would include that the individual nominee is not subject to any statutory disqualification as defined under section 3(a)(39) of the exchange act.\\92\\ proposed rule 17ad- 25(c)(4) would require the nominating committee to document the outcome of the clearing agency's written evaluation process in a manner that is consistent with the written fitness standards required under proposed rule 17ad-25(c)(3). finally, one commenter suggested that the majority independent director requirement could be evaded by any supermajority requirement for voting or quorums of the board.\\89\\ the commission is aware that some registered clearing agencies currently apply supermajority requirements in certain scenarios, such as a requirement that three- fourths of an entire board shall constitute a quorum for purposes of electing the board chair.\\90\\ policies and procedures to identify, mitigate, or eliminate existing or potential conflicts of interest required under rule 17ad-25(g) generally should provide for the clearing agency to evaluate whether any supermajority requirements in any of the registered clearing agency's rules, policies, and procedures would allow directors with potential conflicts of interest to steer the clearing agency in service of those personal interests by avoiding any mechanisms that might require mitigation or elimination (e.g., recusal by the director on the matter at hand) of the conflict of interest. such requirement helps ensure that the clearing agency can evaluate potential conflicts of interest that may require a director to recuse as to certain matters before the board. proposed rule 17ad-25(c)(3) would require the nominating committee to specify and document fitness standards, which must be approved by the board. with respect to proposed rule 17ad-25(c)(4)(iii), which would give the nominating committee discretion to determine how to consider the views of other stakeholders, the commission stated that relevant stakeholders generally would include persons and entities that access the national system for clearance and settlement indirectly (e.g., institutional and retail investors), entities that rely on the national system for clearance and settlement to more effectively provide services to investors and market participants, and other market infrastructures.\\95\\ \\95\\ id.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: \\249\\ the commenter recommended ``that the commission include a definition of net tangible book value in the final rule to enhance the usefulness and comparability of the dilution disclosures for investors in spac transactions and other registered securities offerings as applicable.'' under item 506, a company is required to provide disclosure regarding dilution when (1) the company is not subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act and is registering an offering of common equity securities where there is substantial disparity between the public offering price and the effective cash cost to officers, directors, promoters, and affiliated persons of common equity acquired by them in transactions during the past five years, or which they have the right to acquire; or (2) the company is registering an offering of common equity securities and the company has had losses in each of its last three fiscal years and there is a material dilution of the purchasers' equity interest. the commission proposed several new rules that would require additional information about spac dilution in connection with registered offerings by spacs, including ipos, and in connection with de-spac transactions.\\222\\ with respect to registered offerings by spacs (including ipos) other than de-spac transactions, the commission proposed item 1602(a)(3) and (4), (b)(6), and (c).\\223\\ with respect to de-spac transactions, the commission proposed item 1604(a)(3), (b)(4), (5), and (6), and (c).\\224\\ each of these proposed disclosure requirements is addressed in more detail below. \\231\\ this commenter also said that ``a maximum redemption scenario for a spac would vary across different de-spac transactions'' because of the various ways the redemption level is impacted, including by the spacs' governing documents, listing requirements, and negotiated conditions in the de-spac transaction.\\232\\ the commenter observed that ``some de-spac transactions are structured such that certain funding mechanisms, such as backstop, forward purchase or pipe arrangements, apply only in the event of certain redemption thresholds, further complicating the ability to make the assumptions required by proposed item 1602(a)(4).'' the commenter suggested disclosing ``the percentage ownership of the surviving company at various hypothetical share increments above $10 per share, utilizing the treasury share method.''\n",
            "🔹 Summary: one commenter recommended the commission require dilution disclosure at a 90% redemption level.\\305\\ we do not believe it is necessary to make such changes to the final rules. final item 1604(c) introductory text and (c)(1) and (2) contain certain changes from the proposal. the deletion of this term and its replacement with the new term helps clarify that registrants should not include any estimates of the assets of any ultimate target company in this calculation. the final rule also states that each material potential source of future dilution outside of the table should include ``sources not included in the table with respect to the determination of net tangible book value per share, as adjusted.'' final item 1604(b)(6) requires the prospectus summary to include a brief description in plain english of the rights of security holders to redeem the outstanding securities of the special purpose acquisition company and the potential dilutive impact of redemptions on non- redeeming shareholders.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: proposed prospectus summary disclosure for registered offerings (including ipos) by spacs other than de- spac transactions, the commission proposed item 1602(b) to require in the prospectus summary a brief description in plain english about, among other things: (1) how the spac will identify and evaluate potential business combination candidates and whether it will solicit shareholder approval for the de-spac transaction, (2) the material terms of the trust or escrow account and the amount or percentage of the gross offering proceeds that the special purpose acquisition company will place in the trust or escrow account, (3) the material terms of the securities being offered, including redemption rights, and whether the securities are the same class as those held by the spac sponsor and its affiliates, (4) the period of time in which the spac intends to consummate a de-spac transaction, (5) any plans to seek additional financings and how the terms of additional financings may impact unaffiliated security holders, (6) in a tabular format, compensation of the spac sponsor, its affiliates, and promoters, and the extent to which this compensation may result in a material dilution of the purchasers' equity interests, and (7) any material actual or potential conflicts of interest between the spac sponsor or its affiliates or promoters and purchasers in the offering, including those that may arise in determining whether to pursue a de-spac transaction. \\326\\ this commenter also expressed the view that the commission should not require disclosure of `` `any plans to seek additional financing and how such additional financing might impact shareholders' in ipo registration statements.'' see also 17 cfr 229.501 (``item 501'' of regulation s-k) (one-page limit for prospectus cover page). for de-spac transactions, the commission proposed item 1604(a) to require that spacs include information on the prospectus outside front cover page in plain english about, among other things: (1) the fairness of the de-spac transaction, (2) material financing transactions, (3) spac sponsor compensation and dilution, and (4) conflicts of interest. one commenter said ``requiring disclosure to be included at least three times in the document (e.g., on the cover page, in the summary, and in the body of the document where the same information often appears multiple times) seems excessive and potentially distracting to investors.''\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the final rule would codify existing disclosure practices in this regard and serve to standardize the disclosure across a variety of state or foreign law requirements. in response to a commenter's view that the adoption of proposed rule 145a may result in the requirement to use form s-4 or f-4 for all de-spac transactions, thus rendering item 1608 unnecessary,\\457\\ we note that there are certain situations today,\\458\\ and there could be situations under future spac structures, in which item 1608 would still be applicable and provide security holders with important disclosure to use in making their investment decision. second, in item 1605(b)(5) and (6), we have deleted the phrase ``, if material'' to align the phrasing with the existing disclosure requirements in item 4 of form s-4 \\351\\ as it was our intent to capture the same information at the same threshold and we did not intend for the phrasing to imply that the accounting treatment or federal income tax consequences may not be material disclosure in a business combination transaction.\\352\\ \\351\\ see disclosure requirements in (a)(5) and (a)(6) under item 4 of form s-4. accordingly, as adopted: final item 1605(b)(3) requires: ``a reasonably detailed discussion of the reasons of the spac and the target company for engaging in the de-spac transaction and reasons of the spac for the structure and timing of the de-spac transaction and any related financing transaction;'' final item 1605(b)(4) requires: ``an explanation of any material differences in the rights of spac and target company security holders as compared with security holders of the combined company as a result of the de-spac transaction;'' and final item 1605(b)(6) requires: ``the federal income tax consequences of the de-spac transaction to the spac, the target company, and their respective security holders.'' we believe that the approach taken in final item 1606(a) represents an appropriate balance between our goal of providing more transparency around the spac's decision to proceed with a particular de-spac transaction and the concerns raised by commenters that the proposed rule would create a new substantive corporate law requirement \\381\\ as well as other concerns raised by commenters, including increased liability and risks of litigation and decreased de-spac transactions.\\382\\ the new disclosure requirement will help achieve the same goal sought by the proposed fairness determination requirement-- enhancing spac security holders' ability to assess the spac's decision to proceed with a particular de-spac transaction--without imposing new procedural obligations regarding how such a decision is made.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: although different in form from traditional capital raising in an ipo, the purpose of a de-spac transaction is to provide the target company with capital and access to the public markets.\\903\\ in the course of such a transaction, regardless of the transaction structure, public shareholders of the spac become owners of the combined operating company through the business combination.\\904\\ given this, in the context of a de-spac transaction, interests in the typically private target company are dispersed to the public via a business combination with a spac. for the avoidance of doubt, this guidance does not implement proposed rule 140a. while they take the form of a business combination, de-spac transactions serve as the means by which a private company may enter the public market for the first time and thus are the equivalent of an ipo by the target company. for example, a spin-off is not traditional capital raising; yet, in certain circumstances, has been found to constitute a distribution of securities for the purposes of section 2(a)(11).\\899\\ in the proposing release, the commission stated that the de-spac transaction marks the introduction of the private operating company to the public capital markets and is effectively how the private operating company's securities ``come to rest''--in other words, are distributed--to public investors as shareholders of the combined company.\\900\\ \\899\\ a ``spin-off'' is a transaction by which a parent company distributes shares of a subsidiary to the parent company's shareholders. there, the court held that the various credit rating agency defendants could not be liable as underwriters section 2(a)(11).\n",
            "🔹 Summary: second, the commission proposed new article 15 of regulation s-x and related amendments to more closely align the required financial statements of private operating companies in connection with these transactions with those required in registration statements on form s-1 or f-1 for an ipo.\\920\\ the commission is adopting those rules mostly as proposed, with certain changes discussed below. first, the commission proposed new rule 145a under the securities act that would deem such business combination transactions to involve a sale of securities to a reporting shell company's shareholders. a. shell company business combinations and the securities act of 1933 the issues the commission is addressing with the adoption of both of these sets of final rules are common to these shell company transactions, regardless of whether the shell company is a spac. in response to concerns regarding the use of shell companies \\919\\ as a means of accessing the u.s. capital markets, the commission proposed new rules that would apply to business combination transactions involving shell companies, which include de-spac transactions.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: the commission also proposed to amend rule 1-02(d) to include the following new provision: ``see sec. since proposed rule 15-01(d) would require the application of rule 3-05 or 8-04, which in turn would require application of 17 cfr 210.1- 02(w)(1) (``rule 1-02(w)(1)'' of regulation s-x) in measuring significance, the commission also proposed amendments to rule 1- 02(w)(1) and a new rule 15-01(d)(1) to change how significance is measured in a shell company business combination transaction. \\1058\\ letter from vinson & elkins (also expressing the view that exchange act rule 12b-20 or securities act rule 408(a) would require disclosure of the spac's financial statements if they were material). commission staff has taken the position that existing securities act rule 408(a) and exchange act rule 12b-20, elicit financial statements of a business (e.g., ``company c'' in the above example) acquired or probable of being acquired by the target business (e.g., ``target business b'' in the example) in a shell company business combination filed in a registration statement or proxy statement only when omission of those financial statements would render the target business's financial statements substantially incomplete or misleading.\\1016\\ the commission proposed rule 15-01(d) of regulation s-x to reduce the judgment required in determining when to include financial statements of a business other than the shell company registrant or its predecessor and instead provide certainty by requiring application of rule 3-05 or rule 8-04 of regulation s- x,\\1017\\ aligning with the reporting in an ipo when there is a similar acquisition. \\946\\ section 2(a)(3) of the securities act broadly defines the terms ``sale'' or ``sell'' to include every contract of sale or disposition of a security or interest in a security, for value.\\947\\ finding it necessary for investors to have the protections of the securities act, the commission has previously applied this definition broadly, including in cases where there is no affirmative decision from investors to buy or sell securities.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: several commenters responded to a request for comment that asked whether we should amend the form 8-k requirement to provide an exception to the required form 10 type-information so that the financial statements of the acquired business need not be presented for any period prior to the earliest audited period of that acquired business previously presented in connection with a registration, proxy, or information statement of the registrant.\\1070\\ each of the commenters that responded to the request for comment supported the exception,\\1071\\ with one commenter stating that it was not clear why an earlier annual period would be required in the form 8-k filed after consummation of the merger when such information was not considered necessary for an investment decision by the spac's shareholders.\\1072\\ no commenters opposed such an exception. see supra note 1068. we agree with the comments suggesting that, when the predecessor meets the conditions of an egc at the time of filing the form 8-k, the registrant should not be required to present audited financial statements for any period prior to the earliest audited period presented in the predecessor's financial statements in connection with a de-spac registration or proxy statement of the registrant.\\1074\\ the final rule provides that, when, at the time of filing of the item 2.01(f) form 8-k, the predecessor meets the conditions of an ``emerging growth company,'' as defined in securities act rule 405 or exchange act rule 12b-2, the registrant need not present audited financial statements for the predecessor for any period prior to the earliest audited period presented in its financial statements included in a previously filed registration or proxy statement for the transaction resulting in the loss of shell company status. currently, a form 8-k filed pursuant to item 2.01(f) may require three fiscal years of financial statements for an acquired business that is the predecessor to a shell company, while only two fiscal years may be required in the form s-4 for the de-spac transaction for the same company under rule 15-01(b).\\1069\\ for example, an egc that is not an src would need to present an additional year of financial statements within four business days of consummation of the de-spac transaction. a former shell company may not use form s-8 until at least 60 calendar days after the company is no longer a shell company and has filed current form 10 information; \\1080\\ \\1080\\ see general instruction a.1, form s-8 (17 cfr 239.16b); shell company adopting release, supra note 943. for three years following the change in shell company status, a former shell company is an ``ineligible issuer'' under rule 405 that may not, among other things, use free writing prospectuses for communications during a registered offering or rely on the safe harbor of rule 163a from section 5(c) of the securities act for pre-filing communications; \\1081\\ and \\1081\\ see 17 cfr 230.165(e)(2)(ii); 17 cfr 230.163a(b)(3)(ii); securities offering reform, release no. as highlighted in the proposing release, application of the proposed amendment to rule 11-01(d) that would treat a shell company as a business could have resulted in significance testing of a future acquired business (i.e., numerator) being measured against pro forma amounts that combine the shell company and target private operating company (i.e., denominator).\\1065\\ because the proposed amendment to rule 11-01(d) is not being adopted, the shell company will not be included in the denominator, similar to how proceeds from an offering would not be included in the comparison.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: a few commenters also sought clarification that the staff guidance provided in questions 101.01, 101.02 and 101.03 of the compliance and disclosure interpretations relating to non-gaap financial measures (last updated december 13, 2022) \\1094\\ will continue to apply, notwithstanding adoption of proposed item 10(b)(2)(iv).\\1095\\ \\1094\\ the interpretations relate to whether certain forecasts are considered non-gaap financial measures, as that term is used in item 10(e) of regulation s-k and regulation g. \\1095\\ letters from aba, goodwin. should we amend item 1.01 of form 8-k to require the filing of the business combination agreement as an exhibit to the form 8-k filing (as opposed to allowing the agreement to be filed as an exhibit to a subsequent periodic report)? also regarding item 1609(c), one commenter expressed the view that projections are included in a de-spac transaction disclosure document to describe the basis upon which the directors of the spac approved the transaction, not to serve as a basis for investors to make an investment decision.\\1112\\ the commenter also indicated that ``projections are routinely disclosed in proxy statements and registration statements as the basis for fairness opinions issued at the time of the execution of the merger agreement of the public merger, but the sec has not historically required the parties to the merger to confirm the projections in connection with each filing.'' ); proposing release, supra note 7, at 29504 (request for comment number 150) (``should we consider requiring additional disclosures, such as more disclosure on the private operating company or risk factor disclosure, in a form 8-k filed pursuant to item 1.01 of the form disclosing that the parties have entered into a business combination agreement? pursuant to the proposed amendments, the guidance in amended item 10(b) would apply to any projections of future economic performance of both the registrant and persons other than the registrant (which would include a target company in a de-spac transaction), that are included in the registrant's commission filings.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: if additional disclosure is included in the form s-4 amendment to support the statement required by item 1609(c), the commission staff will need adequate time to review the new disclosure before the registrant's request for acceleration of effectiveness of the form s-4 is submitted as is the case currently when new disclosure is included in a form s-4 amendment. based on the commission staff's experience, form 8-k filings in connection with the announcement of a de-spac transaction may contain projections in the exhibits to the form 8-k filings, including in investor presentation materials featuring projections that also have been provided by the spac to pipe investors. \\1135\\ for example, a statement made in response to item 1609(c) as of the date of the final form s-4 amendment prior to the registrant's request for acceleration of effectiveness could be considered to be made as of the ``most recent practicable date prior to the date of the disclosure document required to be disseminated to security holders'' if the date of the final prospectus disseminated to shareholders is within five days following effectiveness of the subject registration statement on form s-4. instead, the final amendment to item 10(b) acknowledges that projections have traditionally included certain line items, but registrants are free to determine which line items are appropriate to include in projections. item 10(b), as updated in this release, will continue to provide helpful guidance for all companies that publicly disclose projections in commission filings.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: section 3(a)(2) of the investment company act generally defines ``investment securities'' to include all securities except government securities, securities issued by employees' securities companies, and securities issued by majority- owned subsidiaries of the owner which are not investment companies or certain private investment companies. a. background the commission proposed rule 3a-10 under the investment company act, which would have provided a safe harbor from the definition of investment company under section 3(a)(1)(a) of the investment company act \\1140\\ for certain spacs.\\1141\\ as discussed in the proposing release, in recent years, the number of spacs has grown dramatically,\\1142\\ and some spacs and their sponsors have sought to operate spacs in ways that suggest that spacs and their sponsors should increase their focus on evaluating when a spac could be an investment company. nevertheless, a spac might engage in certain activities that would raise serious questions about whether it is an investment company under the investment company act, including activities that would affect a spac's analysis under the tonopah factors. if a spac owns or proposes to acquire 40% or more of its total assets in investment securities, it would likely need to register under the investment company act unless an exclusion from the definition applies. the views below are intended to assist spacs in analyzing their status under these sections, particularly with regard to how spacs may apply the five-factor test that is traditionally used to determine whether an issuer is an investment company under section 3(a)(1)(a) (known as the tonopah factors).\\1146\\ \\1144\\ this guidance is intended to address the status of a spac from the time of the spac's initial offering until it completes its de-spac transaction.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: \\1167\\ see supra note 1146. a spac that holds only the sort of securities typically held by spacs today, such as u.s. government securities, money market funds \\1168\\ and cash items prior to the completion of the de-spac transaction, and that does not propose to acquire investment securities, would be more likely not to be considered an investment company under section 3(a)(1)(c). \\1166\\ as stated in the proposing release, a spac that purchases multiple companies as part of a single transaction would not be engaging in the types of activities that raise investor protection concerns addressed by the investment company act as it would still be seeking to be primarily engaged in the business of an operating company or companies after the de-spac transaction and not be engaged in investment management activities. \\1165\\ a spac that does not hold any securities would generally not implicate the investment company act, unless it proposes to engage in the business of being an investment company as defined in section 3(a)(1) of the investment company act. for example, an issuer that holds these assets, but whose primary business is to achieve investment returns on such assets would still be an investment company under section 3(a)(1)(a). \\1168\\ the term ``money market fund'' refers to those money market funds registered under the investment company act and regulated pursuant to 17 cfr 270.2a-7 (rule 2a-7 under the investment company act).\n",
            "🔹 Summary: depending on the facts and circumstances, the management of a spac also could cause spac sponsors to come within the definition of ``investment adviser'' in section 202(a)(11) of the investment advisers act of 1940.\\1171\\ that section generally defines an investment adviser as any person who, for compensation, engages in the business of advising others, either directly or through publications or writings, as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities, or any person who, for compensation and as part of a regular business, issues or promulgates analyses or reports concerning securities. \\1172\\ see request for comment on certain information providers acting as investment advisers, release no. 428 (aug. 31, 2011) (``the commission next considers how and where the issuer's employees spend their time and effort. the definition generally includes three elements for determining whether a person is an investment adviser: (i) the person provides advice, or issues analyses or reports, concerning securities; (ii) the person is in the business of providing such services; and (iii) the person provides such services for compensation. where employees spend considerable time managing the investment securities, there is greater likelihood that the issuer is primarily engaged in the investment business.''\n",
            "🔹 Summary: \\1176\\ specifically in adopting rule 419, the commission stated that ``although [an escrow or trust account established by blank check companies that comply with rule 419 under the securities act] may be an investment company under the investment company act of 1940, in light of the purposes served by the regulatory requirement to establish such an account, the limited nature of the investments, and the limited duration of the account [i.e., 18 months], such an account will neither be required to register as an investment company nor regulated as an investment company as long as it meets the requirements of rule 419.'' \\1175\\ see investment company act rule 3a-2 and securities act rule 419. we note that while exchange listing rules contemplate potentially longer spac lifespans, those rules were adopted for a different regulatory purpose and do not address investment company status concerns. in addition, the commission took the position that accounts of certain blank check companies relying on rule 419 need not be required to be regulated under the investment company act in part because, among other things, the rule limits the duration of such accounts to 18 months and restricts the nature of investments.\\1176\\ a spac that operates beyond these timelines raises concerns that the spac may be an investment company, and these concerns increase as the departure from these timelines lengthens. in evaluating whether a spac has reached such a point in time, a spac should consider how its duration falls within the framework of the investment company act, the rules thereunder, and past commission positions, including rule 3a-2 under the investment company act and the commission's position regarding rule 419 under the securities act.\\1175\\ rule 3a-2 provides a one-year safe harbor to so-called ``transient investment companies'' which are issuers that, as a result of an unusual business occurrence may be considered an investment company under the statutory definitions but intend to be engaged in a non-investment company business. blank check offerings, supra note 3, at text accompanying n.32; see also 17 cfr 230.419(e)(2)(iv) (``if a consummated acquisition(s) meeting the requirements [of rule 419] has not occurred by a date 18 months after the effective date of the initial registration statement, funds held in the escrow or trust account shall be returned [to investors.]'').\n",
            "🔹 Summary: additionally, the final rules to amend or otherwise clarify the existing liability framework would affect those same parties (and certain individuals at those parties). the final rules also include several provisions to help ensure that shareholders more consistently receive the full protections of securities act disclosure and liability provisions in connection with the de-spac transaction. 99 (2017); klausner, ohlrogge & ruan, supra note 18. the final rules include a number of additional disclosure requirements that help address information asymmetries between investors \\1184\\ and the spac,\\1185\\ which will enable investors to make more informed investment and voting decisions. i. spac exchange listings spac listings have migrated from the over-the-counter (otc) market to three national securities exchanges: first, nyse american (formerly, the american stock exchange (``amex'')); then, the nasdaq stock market (``nasdaq'') and the new york stock exchange (``nyse'') (see table 2).\\1200\\ \\1200\\ spacs first were listed on the amex in 2005. the commission approved the nyse's proposed rule change to adopt listing standards to permit the listing of spacs on may 6, 2008, and approved nasdaq's proposed rule change to adopt listing standards to permit the listing of spacs on july 25, 2008. see release no. nyse, nasdaq, and nyse american have rules setting forth listing requirements for a company whose business plan is to complete an ipo and engage in a business combination.\\1201\\ among other things, the rules of all three exchanges permit the initial listing of spacs only if at least 90% of the gross proceeds from the ipo and any concurrent sale by the spac of equity securities will be deposited in a trust account.\\1202\\ the rules of these exchanges further require that, within three years of the effectiveness of its ipo registration statement (or such shorter period specified in the registration statement under nasdaq and nyse american rules or its constitutive documents or by contract under nyse rules), the spac complete a business combination(s) having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the net assets in the trust account excluding certain costs.\\1203\\ the rules of nyse, nasdaq, and nyse american require that a business combination meeting this 80% requirement be approved by a majority of the spac's independent directors.\\1204\\ the rules of all three exchanges also require, if a shareholder vote is held, that a majority of the shares voted at the shareholder meeting approve a de-spac transaction meeting this 80% requirement.\\1205\\ in addition, the rules of all three exchanges provide that, if a business combination transaction meeting this 80% requirement is approved and consummated, public shareholders voting against the transaction must have the right to convert their shares of common stock into a pro rata share of the aggregate amount then in the trust account net of taxes and working capital disbursements.\\1206\\ under the rules of all three exchanges, if a shareholder vote on a business combination transaction is not held, the spac must provide all shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all their shares for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then in the trust account net of taxes and working capital disbursements, pursuant to rule 13e-4 and regulation 14e under the exchange act, which regulate issuer tender offers.\\1207\\ \\1201\\ nyse listed company manual section 102.06; nasdaq listing rule im-5101-2; nyse american company guide section 119. the rules of the cboe bzx exchange, inc. provide another example of listing requirements that are substantially similar to those described in this section.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: it is possible that exchange act rule 12b-20 or securities act rule 408(a), which both require disclosure of additional information ``necessary to make the required statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading,'' could prompt firms to include these financials notwithstanding the newly final rule 15-01(e), as mentioned by several commenters.\\1421\\ however, under the baseline, the decision to disclose these financials comes from the spac management and could result in fewer disclosures than desired by investors. pslra safe harbor as discussed in section iii.e, we are adopting new securities act and exchange act rule definitions of ``blank check company'' under the pslra. if the projections relate to the target company, the rule requires disclosure of whether the target company has affirmed to the spac that its projections reflect the view of the target company's management or board about its future performance as of the most recent practicable date prior to the date of the disclosure document required to be disseminated to security holders. \\1420\\ see securities act rule 408(a); exchange act rule 12b-20. thus, we expect that the final rule will lead to better informed voting and investment decisions and reduce adverse selection with regard to de-spac transactions.\\1377\\ \\1375\\ see supra section iii.c.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: \\1424\\ while, in the extreme case, the interaction between the adopted definitions of ``blank check company'' under the pslra and jurisdictional requirements for certain forward-looking disclosures may disincentivize companies from engaging in de-spac transactions which, as discussed below, could affect capital formation, it is not expected to affect the efficiency of those transactions that do occur.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: a reduction in shell company business combinations or activity in the spac market could reduce competition between spac sponsors or for investment opportunities in target companies.\\1426\\ such a reduction could result in higher costs for spac investors, depending on the elasticity of those costs. for example, the new definitions of ``blank check company'' under the pslra may interact with existing jurisdictional requirements (such as any requirements to provide projections) which could impose significant additional liability costs on de-spac transactions. for example, to the extent that the final rules lead to shell company mergers (including de-spac transactions) being more attractive to investors, other capital raising avenues that target companies may consider (e.g., traditional ipos) may experience greater competitive pressure. these improvements to the informational environment could also improve competition between spacs and other investment avenues generally, further improving overall capital formation. \\1426\\ reductions in spac formation and de-spac mergers could result from increased costs to de-spac transactions due to differential liability and disclosure requirements compared to non- spac acquirers or other methods of accessing public markets.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: further, our determination not to adopt such a requirement was also based on our view that there are incentives to provide such disclosure voluntarily, as these disclosures would indicate to investors the degree to which conflicts of interest may be ameliorated. the threshold in the final rule of maximum redemptions rather than 100% redemptions does not require these additional assumptions and does include the spac specific redemption details; thus, it is likely more descriptive of possible and expected outcomes. d. reasonable alternatives 1. disclosure-related rules i. require disclosure of policies and procedures that address conflicts of interest as an alternative to item 1603, we considered whether to adopt a complementary requirement to describe or to file as an exhibit any policies and procedures used or to be used by a spac or by a target company to minimize potential or actual conflicts of interest related to disclosures provided in response to items 1603(b) or to describe any spac policies and procedures related to duties of spac officers or directors owed to other companies in connection with disclosure required under item 1603(c). re-determine smaller reporting company (src) status of a post- business combination company without a public float test as another alternative, we considered whether the re-determination for src status of the combined company following a de-spac transaction should require only a re-measurement of the revenue component of the src test and not its public float component. \\1432\\ the commission's edgar electronic filing system generally requires filers to use ascii or html for their document submissions, subject to certain exceptions.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: as a registration statement would not necessarily be required in all transaction structures, the costs of such an alternative would also be less than the costs of liability associated with the purchase and sale of securities and potential securities act registration of shell company business combinations under final rule 145a, to the extent no exemption is available for the transaction. under this alternative, regardless of the document that is filed with the commission (e.g., proxy or information statement, schedule to, or form 8-k), the set of disclosures investors receive would be comparable to that which they would receive had a registration statement been filed for the transaction. 4. enhanced projections disclosure the amendments to item 10(b) of regulation s-k present the commission's updated views on projected performance measures and include a statement that projections based on a non-gaap financial measure should include a clear definition or explanation of the non- gaap measure, and a description of the gaap financial measure to which it is most closely related. in addition, to the extent there is not an available exemption for the reporting shell company business combination, only with securities act registration do investors receive the full panoply of available protections under that act that they would receive in a traditional ipo, such as a private right of action under section 11. only by specifying that a sale occurs would investors necessarily receive all of the protections that apply in connection with all purchases and sales of securities under the federal securities laws, such as the availability of private actions under section 10(b) and rule 10b-5.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: the income test requires that a fund invest its assets so that at least 80% of the income that it distributes will be exempt from federal income tax or from both federal and state income tax. accordingly, a tax-exempt fund applying the income test will be required to assess its portfolio on an at-least quarterly basis to determine whether the fund's assets are invested so that at least 80% of the income that it distributes will be exempt from federal income tax or from both federal and state income tax. rather than require additional disclosure that acknowledges drift or to provide a separate standard for funds that include the term ``managed'' in their name, we are adopting a requirement to invest in accordance with the 80% requirement ``under normal circumstances,'' combined with a set time frame to come back to 80%, to balance these concerns. \\165\\ see 2001 names rule adopting release, supra footnote 8, at n.32 and accompanying text; see also investment company names, investment company act release no. we received many comments supporting the retention of the time-of- investment test and urging the commission not to adopt an approach that would require continual compliance monitoring.\\166\\ several commenters stated that the time-of-investment test is a standard that is used in other portfolio compliance tests under the investment company act and that consistency with how fund holdings are measured across investment company act rules would therefore be a preferable approach in the context of the names rule.\\167\\ the proposed approach, which would have removed the time-of-investment test, would instead have effectively required that fund managers reassess portfolio investments' characteristics for consistency with the fund's 80% investment policy every time the fund makes a new investment, and to take corrective action almost immediately upon identifying any departure from 80%.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: this provision in final rule 35d-1 addresses tender offers but does not specifically address the price at which repurchase offers must be conducted for a fund to be eligible for this exception because the investment company act rules already address the price (net asset value) at which closed-end funds and business development companies conducting periodic repurchase offers are required to repurchase shares. \\303\\ ``oversubscribed'' in this case means shareholders have tendered or requested repurchase of a greater number of shares than the fund has offered to purchase (or ultimately purchases) in accordance with applicable commission rules including rule 13e-4 under the exchange act and rule 23c-3 under the investment company act. \\302\\ the final amendments do not frame the requirement to obtain shareholder approval under certain circumstances as the requirement to adopt a ``fundamental policy.'' while the final amendments do retain the requirement to obtain a shareholder vote under certain circumstances, which the proposed approach effectively would have required, we believe that this is an appropriate use of the commission's authority under section 35(d), and in light of the fact that the requirement to seek a shareholder vote under the final amendments is triggered only where a fund chooses a name that conveys a particular investment focus. as an alternative to the requirement to make their 80% policies fundamental policies, the current names rule permits funds other than tax-exempt funds to provide shareholders with 60 days' prior notice of such changes.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: because our amendments seek to make rule 3-05 more consistent with rule 3-06, the final amendments do not include an incremental disclosure requirement within rule 3- 05 to disclose material information impacting any pre-acquisition period that would otherwise be required absent the use of amended rules 3-05 and 3-06. however, we observe that existing requirements, such as those in item 303 of regulation s-k, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, and rule 4-01(a) would require such disclosure when it is material to the registrant, and we believe that information would be sufficient for this purpose. the commenter suggested as an example that the commission could consider requiring an initial public offering registrant to provide financial statements for the same number of periods as required in subsequent securities act and exchange act filings or for the same number of periods as the 50 percent threshold would require, prior to proceeding with a securities offering. we also believe that rightsizing our acquired business financial statement requirements appropriately balances the need to provide investors with information necessary for making informed investment decisions with the goal of minimizing compliance costs that can delay or preclude access to public markets, particularly when going public may not have been contemplated at the time an acquisition occurred.\\190\\ \\190\\ in adopting these changes, we note that item 303 of regulation s-k requires identification of known trends, demand, commitments, events and uncertainties and rule 4-01(a) of regulation s-x requires that a registrant provide ``such further material information as is necessary to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.'' further, even without the major significance requirement to include some, but not all, of the previously filed pre-acquisition financial statements of the acquired business, regulation s-x provides that a registrant must provide ``such further material information as is necessary to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.'' these final amendments also eliminate the requirement that rule 3- 05 financial statements be provided when they have not been previously filed or when they have been previously filed but the acquired business is of major significance.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: \\241\\ the footnote disclosure to provide an explanation of the impracticability of preparing financial statements that include the omitted expenses is not applicable to rule 3-14 financial statements because rule 3-14 does not contain an impracticability condition. the amendments to rule 3-05 are intended to reduce the burdens of preparing disclosure about immaterial acquisitions and negotiating with sellers to timely provide historical financial statements, while the new requirement to provide pro forma financial information that shows the aggregate effect of the acquired businesses in all material respects should make it easier for investors to understand the overall effect of those acquisitions on the registrant. the final amendments limit this modification to the investment test because the asset test and income test do not apply to rule 3-14 real estate operations. as discussed in the proposing release, we believe that further aligning rule 3-14 with rule 3-05 will reduce complexity by standardizing the requirements for acquired businesses overall while retaining the industry specific disclosure necessary for investors to make informed investment decisions.\\225\\ \\225\\ see section ii.c.1 of the proposing release. we are also conforming the general format and wording of rule 3-14 to rule 3-05, as appropriate, for consistency and to make the rule easier to follow.\\239\\ \\238\\ see item 8(a) of form 10-k. \\239\\ the changes in rule 3-14 to conform wording include the addition of a paragraph similar to amended rule 3-05(b)(1) about financial statements for certain proxy statements and registration statements on forms s-4 and f-4, as well as the elimination of outdated industry-specific paragraphs (a)(2) and (3), which specify certain disclosures for circumstances that seldom occur today.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: c. final amendments we are amending rule 3-14(b)(2) as proposed to require use of the investment test in rule 1-02(w).\\258\\ we believe this amendment will reduce uncertainty regarding the significance tests and clarify the rule without changing the substance of how it is currently applied. a. proposed amendments the commission proposed to amend rule 3-14 to specify that significance should be based on the investment test in rule 1-02(w). when the test is based on total assets for real estate acquisitions, the commission also proposed to modify the investment amount to include any debt secured by the real properties that is assumed by the registrant. thus, consistent with the proposed amendments for rule 3-05 acquisitions discussed above, the commission proposed to require comparison with the registrant's aggregate worldwide market value. furthermore, because rule 3-14 only requires abbreviated income statements to be filed, additional financial statements would have to be prepared solely for purposes of significance testing if the asset and income tests applied to acquisitions of real estate operations.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: a. proposed amendments the commission proposed to amend form n-14 to make its disclosure requirements consistent with the disclosures required in proposed rule 6-11. specifically, the commission proposed the following amendments: in the case of a fund acquisition, any financial statements and schedules required by regulation s-x would only be required for the most recent fiscal year and the most recent interim period; \\417\\ \\417\\ non-fund acquisitions would continue to be required to follow the other financial statement disclosure requirements set forth in regulation s-x for the periods required by rule 3-05, including any pro forma financial information required by article 11. permit private funds to provide financial statements and schedules that conform to u.s. gaap and article 12 of regulation s-x; require inclusion of the supplemental financial information described in proposed rule 6-11(d), except for the pro forma fee table; \\418\\ \\418\\ the commission proposed to exclude the pro forma fee table from item 14 of form n-14 because it is already required in the prospectus under item 3 of that form. additionally, section 23(a)(2) of the exchange act \\431\\ requires us, when adopting rules under the exchange act, to consider, among other things, the impact that any new rule would have on competition and not to adopt any rule that would impose a burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the exchange act. certain of the amendments may also affect issuers that rely on regulation a and investment companies that must comply with the requirements of regulation s-x. the ``significant subsidiary'' definition in rule 1-02(w) is applied when determining if a subsidiary is deemed significant for the purposes of certain regulation s-x and regulation s-k requirements as well as certain securities act and exchange act rules and forms.\\437\\ because the significance of a subsidiary affects the disclosure required from registrants about the activities of those subsidiaries, the amendments we are adopting to rule 1-02(w) will affect registrants' significance determinations and, as a result of those determinations, registrants' disclosure requirements. \\416\\ see 17 cfr 239.23 (setting forth the requirement for an investment company to file form n-14 to register securities in business combination transactions) and 17 cfr 230.145 (specifying the types of transactions that trigger the form n-14 filing requirement).\n",
            "🔹 Summary: a registrant's ability to provide disclosure for periods prior to an acquisition is often dependent on access to and the cooperation of both the acquired or to be acquired business and its independent auditor. this, in turn, could lead to more informed investment decisions and improved capital allocation efficiency. the age of the acquired or to be acquired business's required financial statements, as well as changes in the acquired business's personnel or its independent auditor that occurred during the historical periods for which financial statements may be required, can impair a registrant's ability to timely meet the financial reporting requirements for such acquisitions, which may impact its ability to access capital within the time frames it needs to operate its business and make investments. the amendments may also permit more timely access to capital. as they relate to significance determinations generally, the amendments are expected to reduce the burden of determining significance by improving the application of the definition.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: \\448\\ we note that most of the studies that document value- decreasing acquisitions use data on acquisitions of targets that were exchange act registered companies. we anticipate that the amendments will generally result in disclosure that is more salient and that any potential loss of information will be mitigated by a registrant's obligation under rule 4-01(a) of regulation s-x to include such further material information as is necessary to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. we also acknowledge that the amendments might affect acquiring firms that acquire private targets more than those that acquire public targets, as financial information of public targets is readily available, regardless of whether rule 3-05 financial statements are required. in this regard, we note that one of the recent studies cited by the commenter finds that the main predictors of post-acquisition underperformance are the method of payment (cash versus stock), the acquirer's pre-acquisition asset growth, and the acquirer's excess cash on the balance sheet.\\449\\ disclosure of these items will be unaffected by the final amendments. we also note: (1) our conclusion that, for various reasons, the amendments are highly unlikely to affect whether a transaction proceeds or not, and (2) it is not the role of the commission to substitute its judgment for that of issuers, shareholders, and other stakeholders regarding an acquisition or disposition transaction.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: 2. audited financial statements for significant acquisitions the amendment to eliminate the requirement to file the third year of rule 3-05 financial statements would reduce registrants' disclosure burden. the amended rules will continue to use income from continuing operations before income taxes for the income test rather than after income taxes as proposed, which should also better reflect the significance of a tested subsidiary or acquired business by avoiding distortions that can occur as a result of the tax status of the entity or the volatility of income taxes. 6. foreign businesses the amendments permit foreign private issuers that prepare their financial statements using ifrs-iasb to provide rule 3-05 and rule 3-14 financial statements prepared using a comprehensive basis of accounting principles other than u.s. gaap or ifrs-iasb to be reconciled to ifrs- iasb rather than u.s. gaap for an acquired business that is a foreign business (as defined in 17 cfr 210.1-02(l)). the amendments also allow rule 3-05 and rule 3-14 financial statements to be prepared in accordance with ifrs-iasb without reconciliation to u.s. gaap for an acquired business that is not a foreign business (as defined in 17 cfr 210.1-02(l)), but would qualify as a foreign private issuer if it were a registrant. see rule 3-05(b)(2) of regulation s-x.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: to the extent that these compliance burdens entail certain fixed costs that do not scale with the size of the acquirer, smaller reporting companies and issuers relying on regulation a may particularly benefit from the adopted changes. \\461\\ see supra note 346. the amendments do not provide additional accommodation for smaller reporting companies as suggested by some commenters.\\462\\ as discussed in section ii.a.7.c above, additional accommodations might potentially complicate application of the rule. \\462\\ see supra section ii.a.7. however, we expect the amendments will ease compliance burdens and simplify the application of our rules for all affected entities.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: these amendments provide consistency between rule 3-06 and rule 3-05 for acquisitions that exceed 20 percent, but do not exceed 40 percent significance, and could also improve registrants' timely access to capital. for example, registrants currently have to test the significance of acquisitions that occurred during the earliest years for which the registrant is required to provide historical financial statements and, if significant, to provide pre-acquisition financial statements of the acquired business. additionally, in acquisitions where integration takes longer than a year, investors will still receive disclosure about material effects of the acquisition through the registrant's management's discussion and analysis.\\463\\ we therefore do not expect the amendments to result in a meaningful loss of material information to investors. we expect the amendments to be especially useful for registrants that complete an initial public offering, as those registrants are most likely not to have been required to file rule 3-05 and rule 3-14 financial statements before filing their initial registration statements. in these instances, a registrant might need to spend additional time or resources, or both, to prepare rule 3-05 and rule 3-14 financial statements for inclusion in a registration statement, which can delay a registrant's offering and hence delay its access to capital.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the amendments also establish or clarify the application of rule 3- 14 regarding scope of the requirements, determination of significance, need for interim income statements, and special significance provisions for blind pool offerings that are consistent with current practice. the amendments also expand the aggregate impact determination to include both rule 3-05 and rule 3-14 acquisitions. however, we do not expect registrants to incur substantial costs to prepare disclosure about such acquisitions because these are activities that typically underpin the decision to make an acquisition. by simplifying and streamlining the historical financial statement disclosure requirement for individually insignificant acquisitions, the amendments may make it easier, quicker, and cheaper for registrants to access capital. in addition to the alignment between rule 3-14 and rule 3-05, the amendments also define real estate operation as a business that generates substantially all of its revenues through the leasing of real property.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: for investors, the amendment to conform the significance threshold for a disposed business to that of an acquired business could facilitate understanding and analysis of rule 3-05 and rule 11-01(b) disclosures by eliminating the inconsistency in reporting between acquisitions and dispositions. \\468\\ under current requirements, pro forma financial information is required upon the disposition (and for certain registration statements and proxy statements, the probable disposition) of a significant portion of a business, if the business to be disposed of meets the conditions of a significant subsidiary under rule 1-02(w). rule 1-02(w) uses a 10 percent significance threshold, not the 20 percent threshold used for business acquisitions under rules 3-05 and 11-01(b). dispositions during the same reporting period. identical thresholds might help achieve internal consistency in financial reporting in evaluating the impact of both types of transactions as well as the net effects.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: any loss of information arising from these amendments will be mitigated by the requirement that investment companies file the schedules required under article 12 of regulation s-x and provide certain supplemental information regarding the acquired funds. the amendments are also consistent with the accommodations typically provided by our disclosure review staff during consultations.\\470\\ permitting investment companies to provide financial statements for private funds that were prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap will reduce compliance burdens for investment companies by potentially reducing the costs related to re-issuing audited financial statements in compliance with regulation s-x. see rule 6-07 of regulation s-x. under the existing disclosure requirements related to acquired businesses, some mergers may be delayed or more costly due to the burdens of compliance with rule 3-05 financial statement requirements (e.g., a private business may not have more than two years of audited financial statements, but the transaction may trigger additional disclosure because the business crosses the highest significance threshold). new rule 6-11 potentially reduces compliance burdens by setting forth financial statement requirements for acquired funds that are specifically tailored for investment companies as compared to rule 3- 05. rule 6-11 deems the acquisition of all or substantially all portfolio investments held by another fund as a fund acquisition.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: 2. approaches to financial statement requirements an alternative to the required rule 3-05 or rule 3-14 financial statements would be to require u.s. gaap or ifrs-iasb, as applicable, business combination disclosures at the time an acquisition is consummated or probable, which include, among other things, supplemental pro forma information about revenue and earnings for the two years prior to the acquisition. however, a stand-alone revenue test may not be a meaningful indicator of significance for the reasons the commission described when it eliminated revenue as a standalone significance test.\\477\\ \\477\\ see separate financial statements required by regulation s-x, release no. also, where a registrant misjudges materiality and fails to provide disclosure, investors would not receive information about the acquired business's financial impact on the registrant until the operating results of the acquired business have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the registrant for an extended period of time. a final alternative to the adopting income test would be to lower the threshold required to meet the revenue component, for example to 15 percent or 10 percent. with respect to the amendment to the investment test, as noted earlier, because investors react to news and information, the anticipation of an acquisition could cause a change in equity value of both the potential acquirer and the potential acquired firm.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: the pwa final regulations also provide a limited transition waiver for the penalty payment with respect to the correction and penalty procedures described in section 45(b)(7)(b) for a failure to satisfy the prevailing wage requirements. as stated in the preamble to the pwa final regulations, the treasury department and the irs have determined that given the complexity of the pwa requirements, the uncertainty regarding the potential retroactive effects of the pwa requirements, and the benefits to tax administration gained with consistency across the various code sections containing pwa requirements, a transition rule is appropriate. the pwa final regulations provide that the penalty payment is waived with respect to a laborer or mechanic who performed work in the construction, alteration, or repair of a qualified facility on or after january 29, 2023, and prior to june 25, 2024, if the taxpayer relied upon notice 2022-61 or the pwa proposed regulations for determining when the obligation to pay prevailing wages began, provided the taxpayer makes the appropriate correction payments to the impacted workers within 180 days of june 25, 2024. these final regulations clarify that this limited transition waiver applies to section 48 provided the taxpayer makes the appropriate correction payments to the impacted workers within 180 days of the publication of these final regulations. similarly, these final regulations also allow taxpayers to use notice 2022-61 for determining when construction begins for purposes of the applicable percentage of labor hours performed by qualified apprentices required under section 48(a)(11) (by reference to section 45(b)(8)) in satisfying the labor hours requirement described in sec. this transition rule also applies for taxpayers that may initially satisfy the boc exception, but later fail to meet the boc exception (for example, by failing to meet certain continuity requirements).\n",
            "🔹 Summary: this commenter requested that the final regulations clarify that the definition does not include tax equity positions. several commenters raised concerns about inconsistency with prior guidance published in the internal revenue bulletin with regard to the beginning of construction rules applicable to section 48. commenters also stated that the proposed regulations would implement the energy project definition differently than a similar rule provided in the beginning of construction guidance and notice 2022-61 (which addresses the application of pwa requirements), by mandating single-project treatment if common ownership and any two factors are met, rather than applying a facts and circumstances test. the treasury department and the irs recognize that this proposed rule may conflict with existing boc guidance and the definition of ``energy project'' that is being adopted in these final regulations. this commenter also raised concerns that this approach creates uncertainty and is thus administratively unworkable with regard to the timing of credit claims. this commenter also suggested removing the related taxpayer rule and instead providing an option to elect to be treated as one taxpayer.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: these final regulations adopt this proposed rule without change. the commenter noted that this approach is similar to the approach used to determine whether energy efficient investments in a commercial building qualify for a deduction under section 179d of the code; this commenter recommended that final regulations provide that the doe program ``energy plus'' model be used to determine the amount of anticipated energy savings. therefore, the final regulations adopt these rules as proposed. the final regulations provide a rule limited to energy properties that generate electricity in direct current. the treasury department and the irs, following consultation with the doe, revise the rule in the final regulations to provide an option when nameplate capacity for the thermal energy storage property is not available, to use the nameplate capacity of the equipment that delivers thermal energy.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: 1.48-14(f)(1) would also provide that no section 45 credit may be determined with respect to any such qualified investment credit facility and that the requirements of section 45 are not imposed on a qualified investment credit facility. rather, the ``limited use property'' doctrine reflects the broader federal income tax principle that the characterization of a leasing transaction for federal income tax purposes is determined by its substance and not its form. a commenter asked that regulations provide guidance regarding the scope of a ``qualified investment credit facility'' and ``qualified property,'' including examples specific to a qualified hydropower facility. consequently, the lessor of the ground loop in the lease financing transaction above may not be eligible for the section 48 credit for the cost of the ground loop insofar as it is treated as having transferred ownership of the ground loop to the purported lessee for federal income tax purposes at the inception of the lease. in the context of a qualified biogas property, a commenter stated that the final regulations should clarify and explicitly state that any new cost paid or incurred by the taxpayer for property that is an integral part of the energy property may be included in the basis of the energy property for purposes of the section 48 credit, without regard to the application of the 80/20 rule at the integral property level and regardless of whether the new costs paid or incurred would generally be eligible for the section 48 credit.\n",

            "🔹 Summary: as a result, the final regulations expand the definition of publicly traded corporation for purposes of section 1297(e) to include more circumstances in which a tested foreign corporation is treated as a publicly traded foreign corporation. the comments suggested that the final regulations include a rule that treats assets that give rise to income subject to section 1297(b)(2)(c) as a passive or non-passive asset to the extent the income that is received with respect to such asset is treated as passive or non- passive by the tested foreign corporation. 1.1297-2(b)(2)(i) (which provides the rule that a tested foreign corporation is deemed to directly own the assets of the look-through subsidiary) in the final section 1297(e) rules. accordingly, the final regulations permit taxpayers to use the default approach, consistent with general u.s. federal income tax principles, of allocating dividends paid out of accumulated e&p based on the ratio of passive to non-passive e&p for each prior year (beginning with the most recently accumulated), or to use one of two administratively simpler alternatives. however, for the avoidance of doubt, the final regulations provide an explicit cross-reference to section 1297(b)(2)(c) to clarify that assets that produce income subject to the related person look-through rule are subject to the general and special rules with respect to treatment of assets under sec.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: 1.1297-2 provided guidance on the application of the look-through rule of section 1297(c) for purposes of the income test and the asset test. proposed sec. a. overview b. look-through partnerships\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the final regulations also provide two new examples illustrating the active partner test. 301.7701-3 to treat a foreign subsidiary of such a foreign corporation as a partnership for u.s. federal income tax purposes may have no u.s. tax consequences other than to affect the determination of whether the foreign corporation is a pfic. accordingly, the definition of look-through partnership is further altered to include certain partnerships in which the tested foreign corporation owns a minority interest if the tested foreign corporation has sufficient active assets and income as determined under the rules of section 1297 apart from the partnership. in regard to the fourth alternative, the treasury department and the irs agree that if a tested foreign corporation is actively involved in the business of a partnership with active business operations, look- through treatment may be appropriate, even if the tested foreign corporation is a minority investor in the partnership, so that the tested foreign corporation may take into account the active assets and income of the partnership rather than treating the partnership investment as passive. the treasury department and the irs recognize that minority shareholders may not be able to compel a foreign corporation to make a u.s. tax election or to make particular investments.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: accordingly, the final regulations do not adopt these comments. because section 1298(b)(7) contains the more specific rule applicable to a tested foreign corporation that owns a domestic subsidiary, the treasury department and the irs have determined that the section 1298(b)(7) coordination rule is consistent with the relevant statutory provisions and results in appropriate treatment with respect to look-through subsidiaries. the preamble to the proposed regulations noted that the treasury department and the irs determined that section 1298(b)(7) should generally take precedence over section 1297(c) when both rules would apply simultaneously because section 1298(b)(7) contains the more specific rule applicable to a tested foreign corporation that owns a domestic subsidiary. the proposed regulations provided that the look-through rule of section 1297(c) does not apply to a domestic corporation if the stock of the domestic corporation is characterized under section 1298(b)(7) as a non-passive asset that produces non-passive income. these comments argued that section 1298(b)(7) was intended to apply only in circumstances in which income and assets would be passive if section 1297(c) applied.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: a comment expressed concern that the proposed regulation did not eliminate a payment of a dividend by a look-through subsidiary to a tested foreign corporation that is made out of earnings and profits not attributable to income of the subsidiary previously included in the gross income of the tested foreign corporation for purposes of determining its pfic status. accordingly, the final regulations provide that, for purposes of the asset test as applied to a tested foreign corporation, the underlying property that is the subject of the eliminated lease or license is characterized as a passive or non-passive asset by taking into account the activities of qualified affiliates of the tested foreign corporation (as discussed in part iv.e of this summary of comments and explanation of revisions). however, the final regulations do not adopt the comment's recommendation to treat all dividends from a look-through subsidiary as eliminated from the tested foreign corporation's gross income even if the dividend is paid out of earnings and profits that are attributable to gross income of the subsidiary that the tested foreign corporation has not included in income. the treasury department and the irs continue to study this recommendation and additional guidance on such elimination is proposed in the 2020 nprm. the treasury department and the irs agree that dividends should be treated as paid out of current earnings and profits and then out of accumulated earnings and profits (beginning with the most recently accumulated), in accordance with section 316, and the final regulations so provide.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: to mitigate this potential issue, the comment suggested the final regulations provide that such a look-through subsidiary be treated as a non-pfic with respect to that tested foreign corporation under certain circumstances. the treasury department and the irs disagree that satisfying a 25 percent threshold for ownership of an entity is sufficient to conclude that the entity's business is sufficiently integrated with that of a tested foreign corporation that the entity's activities should be taken into account for purposes of determining the character of income and assets of the tested foreign corporation. another comment recommended an ownership threshold of more than 50 percent by vote or value by the tested foreign corporation, with a requirement that the tested foreign corporation materially participate in the same or complementary line of business of the activity-conducting subsidiary if it owns more than 50 percent by vote but less than 50 percent by value of the activity conducting subsidiary. if the parent of the affiliated group were domestic (a u.s. corporation or partnership), then any qualified affiliate that is a foreign corporation (including the tested foreign corporation) would qualify as a controlled foreign corporation, and any u.s. investor with at least a 10 percent ownership interest in the tested foreign corporation would be subject to the subpart f rules rather than the pfic rules under section 1297(d). accordingly, the final regulations extend the activity attribution rules to income that would be excluded from fphci under section 954(c)(1)(b) (relating to property transactions), (c)(1)(c) (relating to commodities), (c)(1)(d) (relating to foreign currency gains), (c)(2)(a) (relating to active rents and royalties), (c)(2)(b) (relating to export financing), and (c)(2)(c) (relating to dealers).\n",
            "🔹 Summary: section 1297(f) provides that a qualifying insurance corporation (``qic'') is a foreign corporation that (1) would be subject to tax under subchapter l if it were a domestic corporation, and (2) either (a) has applicable insurance liabilities (``ail'') constituting more than 25 percent of its total assets on its applicable financial statement (``afs'') (``the 25 percent test''), or (b) meets an elective alternative facts and circumstances test which lowers the ail ratio to 10 percent (``alternative facts and circumstances test''). proposed sec. 1.1297-4 elaborated on these requirements accordingly. a. 25 percent test\n",
            "🔹 Summary: a shareholder makes the election on form 8621, which must be attached to the shareholder's u.s. federal income tax return (under the final regulations, there is no requirement to attach also the statement provided by the foreign corporation). 1. predominantly engaged in an insurance business section 1297(b)(2)(b) provides that passive income does not include income derived in the active conduct of an insurance business by a qic. the final regulations do not include a special rule for fully collateralized reinsurance because the decision to fully collateralize reinsurance obligations is not necessarily linked to rating agency requirements and (as noted in comments) many fully collateralized reinsurance companies do not obtain credit ratings. the treasury department and irs request comments on whether further guidance is necessary to clarify how ails are determined or make further adjustments to ensure that similarly situated taxpayers are treated similarly without regard to the financial reporting standard adopted by the foreign corporation. some comments asserted that it would be unduly burdensome for certain shareholders to file form 8621 in order to make the election under section 1297(f)(2).\n",
            "🔹 Summary: some comments requested that the discounting requirement be removed because gaap does not require discounting of liabilities in certain circumstances. 1.1297-4(e)(4), if a foreign corporation had previously prepared a financial statement under gaap or ifrs, it could not cease to do so in subsequent years without a non-federal tax business purpose. a comment requested that this rule be removed because taxpayers should not be required to establish a business purpose for their choice of an accounting standard. if the foreign corporation failed to prepare a financial statement under gaap or ifrs in a subsequent year without a non-federal tax business purpose, it was treated as having no ail for purposes of the 25 percent test and the 10 percent test. 1.1297-4(e)(2) does not discount ail on an economically reasonable basis, the foreign corporation may meet this requirement by choosing to apply the discounting methods required under either gaap or ifrs.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: 1.1297-4(f)(8)) has not been changed, it is not intended to provide a maximum threshold for investment assets and income that may qualify for non-passive treatment under section 1297(b)(2)(b). the proposed regulations defined an insurance business to include the investment activities and administrative services that are required to support (or that are substantially related to) insurance, annuity, or reinsurance contracts issued or entered into by the qic. the comment requested that the definition be broadened to include all investment activities related to insurance, annuity, or reinsurance contracts issued or entered into by the qic. one comment interpreted this definition as potentially excluding any investment activities in excess of the minimum amount required to meet the qic's insurance obligations from the scope of the exception under section 1297(b)(2)(b). although the definition of an insurance business (now contained in sec.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: 1.1297-5(d) defined a qdic as a domestic corporation that is subject to tax as an insurance company under subchapter l of chapter 1 of subtitle a of the code and is subject to federal income tax on its net income. the new active conduct rules are proposed to apply to taxable years of qics beginning on or after the date the treasury decision adopting those rules as final regulations is published in the federal register. 1.1297-5(b) provided a general rule that excluded from passive income certain income of a qic and income of a qualifying domestic insurance corporation (qdic). 1.1297-5 published in the same issue of the federal register as these final regulations that proposes rules for determining whether an insurance company is engaged in the active conduct of an insurance business. consequently, for attribution purposes, a tested foreign corporation was required to apply the section 1297(a) income and assets tests without applying the qdic rule.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: however, the stock or partnership interest held by the qic (and the income it derives from the subsidiary entity) is eligible for the exception under section 1297(b)(2)(b) and sec. 1.1297-5(f) apply without regard to whether a subsidiary entity's assets and liabilities are included in the qic's afs. if assets are measured instead using adjusted bases, the fraction test is designed to provide a proportionate limitation. 1.1297-5(f) provided that, if a qic was treated as earning passive income or holding passive assets of a subsidiary entity under the general look-through rules, then the income could be treated as derived by the qic in the active conduct of an insurance business (and thus treated as non-passive under proposed sec. the proposed regulations provided a special look-through rule that applied to a subsidiary entity in which the qic owned at least 25 percent by value (that is, a look-through subsidiary or a look-through partnership) and which was subject to the look-through rules provided in section 1297(c), proposed sec.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: the comments argued that the aet imposed on the tested foreign corporation, the u.s. corporate tax imposed on the domestic subsidiaries, and the withholding tax imposed on distributions to the tested foreign corporation serve to discourage a tested foreign corporation from artificially overweighting its investment assets held through domestic subsidiaries. one comment noted that the 25-percent-owned domestic corporation is likely to be a holding company without an active trade or business and, thus, the tested foreign corporation would likely be deemed to have a principal purpose of avoiding pfic classification. another comment recommended that, if the domestic subsidiary attribution rules are retained, the final regulations provide an exception to allow shareholders who own less than 5-percent of the top-tier foreign corporation in a structure to apply section 1298(b)(7) to determine pfic status for purposes of the ownership attribution rules in section 1298(a)(2). the imposition of u.s. net income tax on the income from passive assets held by a domestic subsidiary also does not serve as a sufficient disincentive to hold those assets in a domestic subsidiary, because the passive assets may generate a small amount of income or the domestic subsidiary may be leveraged so that its net income subject to taxation is much less than the gross income that would be taken into account under the pfic rules if the assets were held by a foreign affiliate. in that case, section 1298(b)(7) treats the qualified stock held by the domestic corporation as a non-passive asset, and the related income as non- passive income.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: if the tested foreign corporation would not be treated as a pfic under the proposed regulations or the final regulations, the taxpayers who sold the stock during a closed year may have been subject to tax under section 1291 on an excess distribution while taxpayers who continue to hold the stock would be spared taxation under section 1291. finally, while it is true that the application of the once-a-pfic, always-a-pfic rule may apply to historic shareholders and not to new shareholders, the rule as enacted by congress is designed to work in that manner. because the final regulations have removed rules turning off the qdic rule and section 1298(b)(7) for purposes of testing for indirect ownership of a pfic and the rules defining active conduct of an insurance business have been revised and reproposed, the final regulations are significantly less burdensome than as originally proposed. for example, if a taxpayer had chosen to apply the proposed regulations to its earliest open taxable year with respect to a tested foreign corporation that has the same taxable year and that qualified as a pfic in closed taxable years, and the application of the proposed regulations resulted in the tested foreign corporation no longer qualifying as a pfic, to prevent pfic treatment from continuing into that earliest open taxable year and beyond the taxpayer would have had to request the consent of the commissioner to make a late purging election by filing form 8621-a for the year immediately preceding its first open taxable year. however, if the consequence of applying either the proposed regulations or these final regulations to prior open taxable years is that, as of the date of application, a tested foreign corporation that was a pfic ceases to qualify as a pfic, then the once-a-pfic, always-a-pfic rule is implicated and a taxpayer seeking to end pfic status must make a purging election or request the consent of the commissioner to make a late purging election. 1.1298- 3(b) or (c) on form 8621 attached to the shareholder's tax return (including an amended return filed within three years of the due date, as extended under section 6081, of the original return for the election year), or request the consent of the commissioner to make an election with respect to a closed taxable year under section 1298(b)(1) and sec.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: before its amendment by tcja, this exception was provided to a foreign corporation that (i) was predominantly engaged in an insurance business and (ii) would be taxed as an insurance company if it were a domestic corporation. however, under controlled foreign corporation (cfc) and passive foreign investment company (pfic) rules, u.s. persons owning stock of foreign corporations were in some circumstances subject to current tax on some or all of the foreign corporation's income. the treasury department and the irs have also identified actions or positions that foreign companies might take to claim qualification for the passive income exception for income earned in the active conduct of an insurance business even though the nature of their insurance business would not merit an exception under the intent and purpose of the statute. the final regulations provide such details so that taxpayers can readily and accurately determine if their investment is in a pfic, given the significant tax consequences of owning a pfic. the final regulation has been designated by the office of information and regulatory affairs (oira) as subject to review under executive order 12866 pursuant to the memorandum of agreement (moa, april 11, 2018) between the treasury department and the office of management and budget regarding review of tax regulations.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: a shareholder generally makes the election on form 8621, which must be attached to the shareholder's u.s. federal income tax return for each year in which the election applies. the proposed regulations provided that a foreign corporation could satisfy the rating-related circumstances requirement if failure to satisfy the 25 percent qic test was a result of specific capital and surplus requirements that a generally recognized credit rating agency (generally, a.m. best, fitch, moody's, and standard and poor) imposes, and that the corporation complies with these requirements in order to maintain a minimum credit rating needed by the corporation to be classified as ``secure'' to write new business for any line of insurance that it is underwriting. for this election, the final regulations further contain a provision under which a u.s. person who owns stock with a value of $25,000 or less ($50,000 or less if filing a joint return) in a publicly traded foreign corporation is deemed to make the alternative facts and circumstances election with respect to the publicly traded foreign corporation and its subsidiaries (``deemed election''). the treasury department and the irs considered whether runoff- related circumstances should be limited to insurance companies that plan to terminate their business operations, as was required under the proposed regulations, or whether it should also include situations in which (1) an insurance company is merely shifting the focus of its business and running off contracts from an ``old'' business that it had entered into in the past, or (2) an insurance company acquires and manages insurance business that is in runoff, but the company itself does not have a plan of termination. 3. economic analysis of specific provisions of the general pfic rules a. treatment of look-through subsidiaries and look-through partnerships for the purpose of testing whether a foreign corporation is a pfic, the look-through rule of section 1297(c) treats the tested foreign corporation (``tfc'') as holding its proportionate share of the assets of a look-through entity and having received directly its proportionate share of the income of the look-through entity.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: in 2018, the irs released and invited comment on drafts of forms 990-pf (return of private foundation or section 4947(a)(1) trust treated as private foundation), 990-t (exempt organization business income tax return), 1040 (u.s. individual income tax return), 1041 (u.s. income tax return for estates and trusts), 1065 (u.s. return of partnership income), 1120 (u.s. corporation income tax return), and 8621 (return by a shareholder of a passive foreign investment co. or qualified electing fund). 1.1297-4(d)(5)(iv) generally provides that any united states person that owns stock in a publicly traded foreign corporation eligible for the election with a value of $25,000 or less ($50,000 or less if a joint return) is deemed to make the election under section 1297(f)(2) without the need to file form 8621. this rule is intended to provide relief to small shareholders who may not be aware that an election is required. the treasury department and the irs have not estimated the burden for any new information collections arising from either the act or these final regulations. 1.1297-4(d)(5)(iii) is required to be provided by taxpayers that make an election under section 1297(f)(2) to treat a foreign corporation as a qic in order to qualify for the exception from passive income under section 1297(b)(2)(b). 1.1297-4(d)(5)(i) and (ii) is required for a foreign corporation for which a taxpayer makes an election under section 1297(f)(2).\n",
            "🔹 Summary: to provide a bound on the impact of these regulations on businesses, the treasury department and the irs calculated the ratio of the pfic regime tax to (gross) total income for 2013 through 2018 for c corporations that filed the form 8621. total income was determined by matching each c corporation filing the form 8621 to its form 1120. ordinary qef income, qef capital gains, and mark-to-market income were assumed to be taxed at 35 percent (21 percent for 2018), and the section 1291 tax and interest charge were included as reported. thus, the annual burden per taxpayer from the collection of information requirement is $95. these requirements apply only if a taxpayer chooses to make an election or rely on a favorable rule. pursuant to section 7805(f), the proposed regulations preceding these final regulations (reg-105474-18) were submitted to the chief counsel for advocacy of the small business administration for comment on their impact on small business. the statutory provisions in sections 1291 through 1298 (the ``pfic regime'') generally affect u.s. taxpayers that have ownership interests in foreign corporations that are not cfcs.\n",
            "🔹 Summary: section 202 of the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995 (umra) requires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits and take certain other actions before issuing a final rule that includes any federal mandate that may result in expenditures in any one year by a state, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million in 1995 dollars, updated annually for inflation. this rule does not include any federal mandate that may result in expenditures by state, local, or tribal governments, or by the private sector in excess of that threshold. v. executive order 13132: federalism executive order 13132 (entitled ``federalism'') prohibits an agency from publishing any rule that has federalism implications if the rule either imposes substantial, direct compliance costs on state and local governments, and is not required by statute, or preempts state law, unless the agency meets the consultation and funding requirements of section 6 of the executive order. this final rule does not have federalism implications and does not impose substantial direct compliance costs on state and local governments or preempt state law within the meaning of the executive order.\n",
